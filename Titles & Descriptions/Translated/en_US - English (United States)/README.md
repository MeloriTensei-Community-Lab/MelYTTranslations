# English (United States) Translations

Click [here](../../../) to return to the main page.

## Special reasoning
This folder only exists because rarely a few videos are not made in English originally. This serves as a place for these types of videos. For videos that are not English and are translated to another language, please use those as usual.

## Translation Guidelines (specifically for American English)
> Guidelines are placed to ensure the quality control 
> of subtitles are up to par for each translator.
> However, not every language has the same guidelines
> for the rules of translations.
> Thus, the guidelines here mainly focus on
> translation mentality rather than format.

#### Consistent tones and formalities
```
At times, I might get informal as heck. Try to match the tones you've
heard from medias like TV shows, movies or even VTuber conversations.
```

#### Do not keep localized names the way it is
```
My name in English will always be Melori Valentine. If you're unsure of the spelling of other MeloriTensei related specific namings, please refer to other (originally) English subs for reference.
```
