# Title
Fixing the VRoid Skirt Issue<br>

# Description
Skirts made on VRoid are not really meant for proper use. The corners cut on the generation of the model got me frustrated enough to go out of my comfort zone to fix them once and for all, despite not knowing much about model rigging.<br>

Well, that's some knowledge for me I guess. üòä<br>
