I tried covering LOCKDOWN (ISEGYE IDOL) | MeloriTensei<br>

# Description
I tried to cover ISEGYE IDOL's LOCKDOWN during the time when I only had my phone to create content with. While it was a challenge, it wasn't impossible to achieve. I'm just glad that I was undeterred by the death of my PC to continue creating content.<br>
