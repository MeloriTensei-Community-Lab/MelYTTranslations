# Title
Non-Walled-Garden's Guide to Alternatives Apps in iOSiPadOS<br>

# Description
Why should a VTuber tell you what's great left within iOS? That's because we VTubers are people too after all. Check out what I got in store for you! I'm sure you won't disappoint!<br>

==Corrections==<br>
Here are some errors that I slipped during recording, apologies for the inconvenience. (Such errors are marked with an asterisk * in the closed captions.)<br>
1) Self-hosting Bitwarden still requires a subscription license to save files into Vaults.<br>
2) Dashlane now has auditable code, thus my remark calling them "proprietary" might be misleading.<br>
3) Aegis is not on the App Store, I've gone offscript a little. My bad.<br>
4) I did not elaborate "to move" well, what I meant was that it would initiate the photo deletion request on your local gallery after moving so you don't need to go manually delete ones you've copied over.<br>
5) It may come off as passive aggressive, my bad. This particular hatred is only meant to be directed at the excessive trend of "everything needs to be a subscription".<br>
6) Not "suite of programs" but "Photoshop and Illustrator's equivalent" rather.<br>
