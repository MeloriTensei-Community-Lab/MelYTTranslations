# Title
[TF4AF4A] Your senior catches up on assignments (Keyboard typing, chatting)  ASMR Roleplay<br>

# Description
This is my first time doing a roleplay ASMR, unscripted, fully improv around the scenario because I personally dislike writing scripts as it feels unnatural for myself to act on.  It is meant to assume the junior (the listener) met their senior (speaker, me hehe) catching up on a document assignment in a library.<br>

I do wanna have some fun with ASMRs, be it roleplays or pure tingles, so do give me some suggestions on what I should do next and what I can improve on next time ^~^<br>

Oh, while you’re reading this.  Here’s some more context on the sudden content change on my channel.  This ASMR is made entirely on an iPhone and my OG Razer Seiren stereo mic I managed to repair myself.  That is because as of the time of recording and publishing, my only PC died and my broke-ness has left me to creating content entirely on my phone. So, if you like what I’ve been doing and wish to support me on any kind of content creations, please do hit like, comment, subscribe and share me around to boost this audio and channel. ^~^<br>

I hope to see you in upcoming contents to come, tis been Melori Valentine, I bid you a safe travel in the Internet! See ya!<br>
