# Title
Tech Wizardess VTuber Speaks Out! - MeloriTensei's Devlog Feb 2024<br>

# Description
It's been so long since I last made something for you guys. I figured you guys deserve some clarification on what I've been up to behind the scenes. All while I had some fun doing an impression of FalseEyeD for the intro and outro. ðŸ˜‚<br>

This video structure is inspired by  @FalseEyeD  's usual reporting style, check him out!<br>
