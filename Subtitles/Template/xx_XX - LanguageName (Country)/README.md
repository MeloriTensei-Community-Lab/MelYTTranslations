## Translation Guidelines (specifically for [Insert language])
> Guidelines are placed to ensure the quality control 
> of subtitles are up to par for each translator.
> However, not every language has the same guidelines
> for the rules of translations.
> Thus, the guidelines here mainly focus on
> translation mentality rather than format.
