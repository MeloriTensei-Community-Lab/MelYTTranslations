1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
In this long episode, a Burger will be given

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,960
I'M GIVING YOU BURBURGER

3
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:08,000
A kitchen will descend to chaos

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,630
And everything goes to shit

6
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:14,500
OH

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,530
OH SHIT

8
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:22,190
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,300
Kon-Melo!

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,500
This is going to be my first ever non-stream highlight video

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,200
Basically, this was recorded on a whim without involving a stream

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,600
I got sent a game that caught my attention

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,390
that I can't pass off not making a video of

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,230
And here's how it went

15
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:45,830
So I found this game

16
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,000
It's called One Armed Cook

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,600
To put it simply

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,890
Chicken recommended me One Armed Robber

19
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:55,830
But then I saw the developer's page

20
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,130
And they happen to have One Armed Cook

21
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:02,330
Now I'm a kind of big fan of a cook game sometimes

22
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,630
So I thought,

23
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:07,430
Why not drag Chicken himself along this stupid journey
Chicken: 'Ello

24
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:10,160
Chicken: Yes. This is One Armed Cook.

25
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,130
It's basically, well if you've heard of One Armed Robber

27
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:16,700
Well this is the cooking version for it

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,060
Chicken: Yes, looked interesting

29
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:20,760
Yup
Chicken: So, why not play it?

30
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:21,960
Yup, let's give it a try

31
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:23,400
But first
Chicken: C'mon invite me

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,930
The stupid part right is that

33
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:28,200
When I opened this game, there was something that caught my attention

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,700
There was a button down here and I clicked on it and

35
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,160
Stupid enough

36
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,060
It's fucking loot boxes

37
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:37,330
So in my inventory I currently have a coolie hat

38
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,200
Ah yes

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,260
One way to truly explain the fact that I'm Asian.
(Stereotypical Asian BGM)

40
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:43,330
Very nice

41
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,430
Chicken: I had a broccoli hat

42
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:46,660
Nice

43
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,730
Right

44
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,590
So we're gonna create a multiplayer and we're gonna figure out

45
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,790
how this game goes

46
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,830
Because we've never really played this before

47
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,830
So this is entirely just

48
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:02,500
hardcore figuring out I guess

49
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,090
Oh wait we haven't select a lo-...

50
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,290
(Mel stutters)

51
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,960
We haven't select a map

52
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:09,760
Let's start simple, shall we start like

53
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:13,190
With say hot dogs I guess or burgers or something

54
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,060
Chicken: Ah yes, the "easy" one.

55
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:17,500
Yeah let's do burgers
Chicken: Why not?

56
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,430
Chicken: Till this day I still don't know how to put a patty in a bun

57
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,830
(Mel giggles)

58
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,500
You just put, literally you just put

59
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,000
Here let me show you

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,430
So first things first, according to the tutorial

61
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:31,500
you're supposed to toast the buns first

62
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,160
So we put them inside

63
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,500
Chicken: nYes

64
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,660
Chicken: Hamburger

65
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,500
Chicken: Cheeseburger

66
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,360
Chicken: Hamburger

67
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,090
Chicken: That's three hamburgers

68
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,430
Chicken: And a cheese hamburger

69
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:45,190
Chicken: Holy shit you have a rice hat

70
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,860
Yes I have a rice field
Chicken: Nice.

71
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,030
I have a rice fields hat, yes

72
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:52,230
Chicken: Nice
Mel & Filthy Frank: Welcome to the rice fields, motherfucker

73
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:55,430
Chicken: I now know what you mean when you said that.

74
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,900
Yes (Laughs)

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,160
You have to take it to the chopping board

76
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,400
Chicken: Wat?

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,530
And then you grab the knife and slam at it

78
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,500
Chicken: What???

79
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Yes (laughs)

80
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Chicken: Wow..

81
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,400
(Mel laughs)

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,660
Then you take the patties and you just put it on

83
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,560
Literally

84
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,500
Like put it on

85
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,190
And then you close 'er like that

86
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,190
Wait, wait, hold on what kind of burger were they asking for, like...

87
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,000
Chicken: Three normal burgers

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
Put that on...

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
Chicken: PLAP!
Put that on

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,630
Now we serve it to the customer

91
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:34,430
Mel & General Ock: Now we serve it to the customer, there you go sir

92
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,900
Can I stack plates?

93
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,960
No I cannot

94
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:40,560
I have to bring those plates back

95
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:42,000
I assume we have to wash it

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,130
Oh yeah we definitely have to

97
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,400
Hey at least we don't have to use the sponge
(In VRChat, there's a similar cooking game)

98
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,000
We just dip it in the water
(that requires the sponge to clean the plates.)

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,830
We got clean plates now

100
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,660
That we can use

101
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:56,860
I'm surprised it's on without the door open

102
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,190
Oh hello

103
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,800
Bacon cheeseburger

104
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,260
So we need bacons

105
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:02,230
Let's pre-make some

106
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,500
It's not like it's gonna go cold

107
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,430
There's no mechanics for that right?

108
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,460
(Oven beeps)

109
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,260
Uh

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We got some toasty-
Chicken: Oh, it can burn. Damn...

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,400
Where's the rat?
Chicken: Welp, not my fault.

112
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,960
Here

113
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:20,330
I'm giving you burger

114
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,330
It would be fun if we could toast these rats though

115
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,360
Chicken: Bruh, imagine.

116
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,330
Actually what if we do that

117
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,690
Chicken: I mean, you could.

118
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,890
Oh my god

119
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,190
(Mel in disbelief)

120
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,260
Chicken: Is it working?

121
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:38,260
Yes

122
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:40,630
It's actually flaming

123
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:42,730
Nice

124
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,730
What the fuck is that?
Chicken: Ahh yes, firery hot rat.

125
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:50,160
Chicken: Oh shit. Everything's on fire!

126
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,130
Oh shit, hold on.

127
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:56,390
Chicken: The bacon's on fire

128
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,160
Chicken: The floor's on fire

129
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,960
Unclean!!

130
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:12,030
Chicken: UNCLEAN!
(Mel giggles)

131
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:13,600
SovietWomble: Can you stop washing each other?

132
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,760
Tom: Unclean!

133
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,000
Zeis: Unclean!!!

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,830
Zeis: Dirty fucking filthy peasants!

135
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,260
Zeis: Unclean!!!

136
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:22,100
Crisis averted

137
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,730
Don't worry

138
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,500
This loss is negligible

139
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,230
This loss is negligible
(N*jisanji 2k24)

140
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:27,190
Also we can check for the orders over here

141
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,600
There's an order list right here

142
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,030
Look at that

143
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,230
(Truck honks twice)

144
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:33,330
Oh hello
Chicken: Honk honk.

145
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,860
What is this?

146
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,600
I ordered one of each

147
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,960
Oh I see

148
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:42,230
Hello, Ratatouille.

149
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,600
Oh they (the customers) eat it so fast.

150
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,030
Can I just-...
Chicken: Just a "nom", and they're done.

151
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:49,690
Oh wow, you just throw it (mouse) in the trash.

152
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:53,460
Just throw the guy in the trash and he'll disappear

153
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:55,830
Wait what?
Chicken: waw...

154
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,390
Chicken: Where the buns at?

155
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,190
The bun-

156
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,060
Wait

157
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,930
I'm bringing in the buns but I'm stuck

158
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,830
Okay

159
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,600
Here, bun-
Chicken: Where de buns??

160
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,660
Buns

161
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:13,100
Did we just chuck this down here?

162
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,160
Oh okay

163
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,190
Chicken: Oh shit, they left.

164
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,890
Waste management

165
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,530
Cheese... cheese...
(James May slams cheese on table)

166
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:20,660
Mel & James May: Cheese

167
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,630
Ham
Chicken: (imitating James May) Cheese.

168
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,690
Oh there's cheese

169
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,360
We got slices of cheese now

170
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:30,030
Normal hamburger on the way

171
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:32,530
Who ordered for that?

172
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,560
Okay

173
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:35,030
(Plate collides with tap)

174
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:36,460
Ah dishes

175
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:37,660
Right

176
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,690
Water

177
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,190
Oh my god

178
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:42,630
It's going rogue

179
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:45,390
Chicken: I think we need more buns

180
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,360
Okay

181
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:47,500
More buns

182
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,430
Right

183
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:50,730
Ordering that

184
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,030
More buns have arrived

185
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:02,160
Chicken: Holy shit
(Mel laughs)

186
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,330
Chicken: That did not go as planned

187
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,130
(Truck honks twice)

188
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,430
Open up

189
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:10,690
Okay

190
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,760
Buns

191
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,800
We're calling optimization

192
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,460
No, don't drive away with my one bun!

193
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:21,530
Oi

194
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:25,660
Chicken: lol.
There's one bun inside (giggles)

195
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,390
(Fire alarm beeps)

196
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,660
Uhh...

197
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,230
The buns are flying away

198
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,530
Don't worry about that

199
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:34,330
Everything's under control.

200
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,960
Everything's under control!

201
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:40,730
Gotta make sure nothing of a value is lost

202
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,430
Chicken: Oh, trust me. EVERYTHING of value was lost.

203
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:46,960
What did you order this time?

204
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,530
Oh

205
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:50,060
Meat.
Chicken: They're all leaving!

206
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:51,930
Oh shit

207
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:55,230
Chicken: One star.
(Mel laughs)

208
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,160
Read reviews

209
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,060
"So tasty"

210
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,230
"Fantastic meal"

211
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:00,800
"Wonderfully flavourful"

212
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,930
"This isn't what I ordered"

213
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:04,330
"There were rats in the restaurant"

214
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,800
"Really tasty and satisfying"
Chicken: waw...

215
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,830
"Restaurant was dirty"

216
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,530
"Couldn't even order any food

217
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:09,730
"Waiters too busy"

218
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:10,360
"Waiters too-

219
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,190
"Didn't take my order"

220
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,530
"I didn't get to order my food"

221
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:14,430
Wait

222
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:18,600
(Mel laughs away)

223
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,730
Chicken: Ahh, yes. Very professional.

224
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:25,600
Very professional indeed (laughs).

225
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,630
Oh my god

226
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:28,500
You want to try that again

227
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,600
Or do you want to try a different food?

228
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's try optimizing the burgers first

229
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,130
Like let's get good at it

230
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:37,760
Chicken: "Get good at it"
(Mel laughs)

231
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,100
Let's get good at it

232
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,260
Now that we figured out the game plan

233
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:46,430
We cook all the buns beforehand

234
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:49,430
Cook everything beforehand
Chicken: Ordering beforehand, heh.

235
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:52,100
Yeah do everything beforehand

236
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,290
The customer will roll in anytime anyways

237
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:57,560
Ready these buns...

238
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:01,700
Okay, these buns are cut.

239
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:05,630
Cheese are cut

240
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:08,200
Okay I'm going to get the orders

241
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,790
Uh two normal hamburgers

242
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,830
Let's take care of these first

243
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,960
Okay, let's get the patty.

244
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:20,930
Patty on

245
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:23,030
Top bun

246
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
Okay burger one coming up

247
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,390
All right next burger

248
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,330
Here you go

249
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,830
Burger

250
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,600
Chicken: Borgar~

251
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,430
Let the cleaning be done

252
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:39,060
What's the-

253
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:40,760
What's the other order?

254
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:43,700
Uh, bacon cheeseburger.
Chicken: Oh, shit. Everything is flying away.

255
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,430
Wait, hold on. How does bacon cheeseburger look like?

256
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:47,000
Burger and-

257
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,100
Okay, everything then.

258
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,790
So bottom bun

259
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,890
Patty

260
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,500
(French Mel) Bacon~

261
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,560
Cheese

262
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:56,860
And then

263
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:57,630
Bu-

264
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:58,290
Top bun?

265
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,130
Where's the top?

266
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,330
There, there's the top.

267
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,100
Did you order bacon cheeseburger?

268
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,790
Yes, you did.

269
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,430
Very nice

270
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:08,830
Right what did you-

271
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,830
Uh, two bacon cheeseburgers...

272
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:15,390
Even if it looks weird it actually-

273
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,790
It may work

274
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,060
Chicken: Yeap

275
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,230
Yep it actually works

276
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,360
Regular hamburger

277
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,700
Oh shit, where's the bottom?

278
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,390
Where's the bottom?

279
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,890
There's more tops than bottoms

280
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,460
Where's the bo- Where's the-

281
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,230
I couldn't find the bottom

282
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,000
Are you tending to normal ham-

283
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,460
Oh yeah bacon cheeseburger then

284
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:39,260
Right

285
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:40,360
Chicken: Cheese

286
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:41,930
James May & Mel: Cheese

287
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,390
There there's the che-

288
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,130
"This isn't what I ordered"

289
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:48,600
Wait what?

290
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,200
"Cheeseburger, cheeseburger, hamburger" okay.

291
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,630
Who ordered for cheeseburger?

292
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:57,000
Who's ordering for cheeseburger?

293
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:59,000
Chicken: "Isn't what you ordered"?

294
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,390
But it's a burger

295
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,460
(imitating French accent) "Incredible food"

296
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:04,360
I had a random thought

297
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:05,200
Chicken: Wat?

298
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,530
Do you wanna-

299
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,260
Do you wanna stream Overcooked with me one day?

300
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:10,430
Chicken: Sure

301
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:11,930
All right

302
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:13,860
Who ordered for cheeseburger?

303
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:16,000
Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese...

304
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,760
You!

305
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,700
Okay

306
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,630
"Great meal" it says

307
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:22,760
"Isn't what you ordered"

308
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,760
What do you mean?

309
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:26,700
Ayy, that's an improvement.

310
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,460
We got two-

311
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:31,560
We got one extra star

312
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:35,760
Very nice
Chicken: Horrendous, absolutely horrendous.

313
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:38,200
Why do they keep saying "it's not what they ordered"

314
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,730
Even though IT IS what they ordered.

315
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,390
I wonder

316
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,860
Chicken: They're scamming me.
(Mel giggles)

317
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:46,060
All right let's try out-

318
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,260
Let's try out hot dogs

319
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:49,000
Let's see let's see how-

320
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,700
How hard can it be you know?

321
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,630
Chicken: Who knows?

322
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:52,860
Hot dogs

323
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:54,890
Chicken: Henry's hot dogs

324
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,860
Okay
Chicken: Oh, joy...

325
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:59,200
Chicken: There's no space to move

326
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,560
Scusi

327
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:03,430
Chicken: It's a clusterfuck.

328
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:06,130
I don't think this alleyway is meant for two people

329
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:09,200
I think one's supposed to be working on the waiting

330
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,290
Sausage and a plain hot dog

331
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,200
Chicken: You're a sausage, sir.

332
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,600
What??? You're supposed to chop these hot dogs...

333
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,100
To make up a hot dog

334
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,500
What?

335
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,390
Uhh, plate.

336
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:20,930
There we go

337
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:22,600
We got plate

338
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,130
In, in you go.

339
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,030
In you go

340
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:28,160
Dang it

341
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,160
Does it work though?

342
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,630
Chicken: Yes.

343
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:31,430
Very nice

344
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,430
As long as it's on the plate,

345
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:34,930
it's all we need

346
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:36,790
Sausage and bread

347
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,160
Plain hot dog

348
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:41,290
Very nice
Chicken: "So tasty~"

349
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:44,000
Mmm so tasty

350
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,700
Wait

351
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,000
Chicken: Move your fat ass!

352
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,930
Wait

353
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:50,930
There's cheese-

354
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:53,700
(Stutters) There's mousetraps

355
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,630
We could make good use of these mousetraps

356
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:58,130
But there's no cheese in the inventory right?

357
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:00,500
Yeah there's no cheese in the inventory

358
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,930
What's the point?

359
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:04,430
(Truck honks twice)

360
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:07,030
Chicken: Honk honk!

361
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:10,130
Oh, we're out of meat. I see.

362
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,260
I'll get to you

363
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,430
Ah. No, get out of the way!

364
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:20,200
We don't have space anymore

365
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,790
Bread

366
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,790
Sausage

367
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,930
Sausage and bread

368
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,830
Sausage

369
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,700
SOSIG
RADAL: SOSIG~

370
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,790
I can look at the orders on the screen here

371
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,700
So that's kind of a good thing

372
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,390
Oh shit

373
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:35,500
Get out of the way

374
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,390
Oh I'm putting the plates up to the front

375
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,630
So it'll be easier for us later

376
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:43,000
Chicken: Ahh, yes. Let me just toss the boxes in there

377
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,730
Chicken: Wee~

378
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,290
Okay

379
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:49,390
Oh my god

380
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,700
Chicken: So far so good, I suppose.
So far so good,

381
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,660
Smooth sailing.

382
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,890
Sausage

383
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,290
(Mel laughs)
Chicken: Hehe, it's flying all over the place.

384
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:05,760
Chicken: Get your ass off the grill.
Sausage!

385
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:10,730
Chicken: Bruh, its not even ON the plate.
(Mel laughs)

386
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,000
Welp, I don't know how this is ON the plate*. But it works, I suppose.
(Mel giggles)

387
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,200
Chicken: By some sort of sorcery?

388
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm a magician. I'm a wizardess!

389
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:25,430
Chicken: (Bri'ish accent) "You're a fooking wizard, Harry."

390
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,330
(Bri'ish accent) I'm a wot?

391
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,500
Chicken: (Bri'ish accent) "You're a fooking wizard, Harry."

392
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,060
(Pissed Bri'ish) I'm not a fooking wizard, Hagrid.
(Mel laugh)

393
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:36,230
Chicken: (Bri'ish accent) "You're a fooking wizard."

394
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:39,600
Reference, if it ain't goddamn obvious enough.
"Hagrid": For God's Sake, Harry. What is with this language?!?!

395
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
"Hagrid": You're a fucking wizard!

396
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,430
"Harry": I don't give a fuck, you fat hairy bastard!

397
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:48,290
"Harry": I'm not a fucking wizard!

398
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:50,830
What is with the sausage and the sausage and breads?

399
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,730
What the fetch?

400
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,330
What?

401
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,200
Oh shit, no!

402
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
No no no, I didn't mean to cut that. (laugh)

403
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,100
I held the knife (laughs)

404
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,030
Did you hear that double slice?

405
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,500
Chicken: I saw that

406
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,930
It went SHING SHING!
Mongral: SHING SHING!

407
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:08,430
(Mel laughs)

408
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,700
We're gaming

409
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,100
Sausage gaming

410
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,890
(Plates colliding result of a glitch)

411
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:19,290
Ting ting ting ting ting ting~

412
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:23,700
Chicken: Nice, a big ass plate and a single sausage.

413
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:25,760
Hot, hot...

414
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:27,700
Nope, that's not hot.

415
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,500
That's not dogs.

416
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,100
Now, that's a dog.

417
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,600
(NFL on FOX Theme)

418
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:39,600
Chicken: Welcome, let me molest your face while you order.

419
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Oh, ohh, yes. Oh, yes~

420
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,660
Chicken: That's a good boy.
You know what I got an idea

421
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:50,200
Let me just put all the sausages and the bread on one place

422
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,130
Leave the knife over here at the ordering table

423
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,930
So when we need it we could use them

424
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:59,200
And I'm gonna start cooking here

425
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,730
Is that raw?

426
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,200
(Slip sound)

427
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,460
(laughs) Why did the plate just fell right into my crosshair?

428
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,760
Chicken: Who knows...

429
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:09,860
Oh?!

430
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:12,530
Chicken: YOU BURNIN' SOMETHING?!

431
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:13,760
Don't worry

432
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:16,530
Crisis averted

433
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:20,530
Don't worry about the dumpster

434
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:21,860
It's fine

435
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,290
The dumpster is fine

436
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:26,330
Chicken: Into the trash you go, rat!

437
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,330
I think it'll work

438
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,890
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

439
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:34,160
Chicken: Eyy, stonks!

440
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:39,390
Ayyy we got 3 star let's go
Chicken: Three stars! Bro... depressing.

441
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,600
How's the review though?

442
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,260
Incredible food there were rats in the restaurant

443
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:45,030
What are you supposed

444
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:46,860
What are we supposed to do?

445
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:49,960
Okay.
Chicken: Mousetraps everywhere, of course.

446
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,500
I put a mousetrap at the door

447
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,290
How the hell did the rat miss it?

448
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:56,500
Chicken: 'cause he's smorter than you
(Mel pssh's)

449
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,000
You want to try a different food?

450
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Chicken: Sure

451
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Alright, pizza.

452
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,890
Chicken: Pizza, let's go~

453
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,000
Whoa, okay

454
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,660
So we got pizza plate thingy

455
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:11,560
Chicken: We got ham, we got cheese*, we got pepperoni.

456
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:14,400
Okay, that's the ordering place.

457
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,230
This is the front door presum-

458
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,430
Oh my god you're already here

459
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:19,460
Hello

460
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:20,960
Nice to meet you

461
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:23,030
Am I supposed to click something for that?

462
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,090
Oh okay

463
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:27,530
Mozzarella and diavola

464
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:30,530
Which is like mozzarella but with "pepeloni".

465
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:34,200
Chicken: Oh, so you're supposed to put the dough in there.

466
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,030
Brrr...

467
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:41,860
Then, I guess tomatoes...

468
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:43,430
Sauce... How do we...?

469
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:46,000
Do we need a knife or something?

470
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,560
How do we

471
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,230
Is there a can opener that we can use or something?

472
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:53,260
Oh, it's right here!

473
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:56,530
We chuck it here and then it just do that

474
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,230
Oh that's hilarious

475
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,590
Then we do that

476
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,500
Every pizza should have a tomato sauce

477
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,530
This is like "Work in a pizza place" but different
Chicken: More chaotic.

478
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,590
Yes. Hehe.

479
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,200
A whole lot more chaotic, actually.
Chicken: Wait, how do you pick up the pizza?

480
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,730
Chicken: Oh, you're supposed to use this paddle.

481
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,630
Yep

482
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:23,430
Oh wow, how does that work?

483
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:27,960
Chicken: I can't stick it in. I can't stick it in.
Downwards.

484
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:30,900
Chicken: I can't stick the dick inside :)

485
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,000
No

486
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:37,860
How do I stick this...

487
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,400
Hold on, wait wait wait hold on hold on.

488
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,500
Put it, lay it down.

489
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Nani?

490
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,400
Oh oh oh

491
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,900
It worked for a second

492
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,760
Hoo hoo, what are we supposed to do?

493
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:53,030
Drop it in, I guess?

494
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:57,590
Wait how do we drop- (laugh)
Chicken: EAT YOUR FUCKING PIZZA! ARGHHH!

495
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,130
How do we drop it in is the question.

496
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,260
Hold on, wait wait, no no no.

497
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:02,290
I, wait, hold on hold on hold on.

498
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:04,530
Uh, let go.

499
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:06,200
(Slips)

500
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,060
Oh.
Chicken: Oh, what the fuck.

501
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,790
Oh shit. (laughs)

502
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,760
Chicken: You... you just thrashed it.
(Mel laughs loudly)

503
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:14,560
Chicken: Bro...
(Mel continues laughing)

504
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:19,900
Chicken: We've already cocked it up!
(Mel laughs more)

505
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,290
Chicken: We've already cocked it up...

506
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,090
Chicken: We've reached the point of no return.

507
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:27,860
(Mel laughs so hard)

508
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:34,730
(Laughs calming down)

509
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:38,030
I love this game (laughs).

510
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,090
Also, there's a rat.

511
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:43,400
Aite, aite aite.

512
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,200
Nay

513
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,760
Off you go

514
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,790
Come on, let me in.

515
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:53,290
Really?

516
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,090
There's only one can of pizza sauce.

517
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:56,330
Okay fine

518
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,530
I won't even care then

519
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,030
How are we doing so far?

520
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,500
Chicken: "This isn't what I ordered"

521
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,090
Chicken: Of course, the cheese fucking flew away.
(Mel laughs)

522
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:07,090
Chicken: Oh my god...

523
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:09,900
Chicken: We've already failed. Haha ha.

524
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,830
Chicken: Uhh, the mozzarella pizza has uhh... went to hell.
Ascended?

525
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,000
Chicken: It has descended to hell.

526
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,500
Chicken: I think it may have been possessed by the devil.

527
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,860
(Mel pssh's)

528
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:23,360
Okay, we need cheese.

529
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:26,430
Shit...
Chicken: Uhh, the pizza's in the shadow realm.

530
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,260
(laughs) Shit...

531
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:33,430
Really? You don't- the box?

532
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,860
Wow, it-
Chicken: How do you even put it on the plate???

533
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,400
Wow the-

534
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,030
This sucker 180's

535
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:41,730
Chicken: Why can't we even hold the pizza?

536
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:44,530
(Mel laughs and raspberries)

537
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:48,290
Chicken: Oh ho ho ho, I think we need to restart.

538
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:52,290
(laughs) Yeah, this whole thing is a shit show

539
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:55,060
We've earned nothing (laughs).

540
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:57,430
Chicken: Bro...
(Mel continues laughing)

541
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:59,630
Chicken: We're so bad at this.

542
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,830
I know right

543
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,830
This is gen-

544
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,430
A genuine shit show

545
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:05,900
One review of "This isn't what I ordered".

546
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,530
Chicken: Reason being: [The cheese flew out of the pizza]

547
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,730
(Mel pssh's)

548
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:13,900
Chicken: AFTER it was cooked and plated.
(Mel sighs)

549
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,130
My god...

550
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:19,200
Alright
Chicken: This shows Asians don't know how to make pizza.

551
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,360
(laughs)

552
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,830
Right, let's try it again.

553
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,130
Chicken: What? The pizza one?

554
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:26,630
Yeah let's see wh-
Chicken: We're going to fail! Trust me.

555
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:31,200
Chicken: Wow, I've already spilled like... most of the tomato sauce.

556
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,900
(Mel laughs) Okay.
Chicken: So, haha, I think we need more tomato sauce.

557
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,230
More tomato sauce coming up

558
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:38,230
(Chicken laughs)

559
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:41,700
Oh shit, there's only like one ladle left inside.

560
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,400
(laughs) Shit...

561
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,530
Oh shit

562
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:48,530
Chicken: It just barely burned it.

563
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,060
(Mel pssh's)

564
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:52,960
Chicken: I was just about to take it out and then it burned.

565
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:54,900
Damn

566
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,460
Chicken: Is this working? No it's not.

567
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:01,560
Chicken: It got sent to the shadow realm. Nevermind.
(Mel laughs)

568
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:04,660
Chicken: Everything's going to shit.

569
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,030
Chicken: This is horrendous

570
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,200
This IS horrendous.

571
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,860
Okay

572
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:13,000
Chicken: How do you even put the pizza on the plate?

573
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,530
I wonder

574
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:18,700
I keep right clicking and it gets sent to the shadow realm

575
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,760
(Mel laughs)
Chicken: Bruh.

576
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:25,200
Wait where did it go? Hold on.

577
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,900
Wait, there's this thing...

578
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,500
What does this thing do though?

579
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,630
Chicken: I don't fucking know.

580
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:31,260
What are we-

581
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,000
What are we supposed to do with the frying pan?

582
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,830
Chicken: Who knows.

583
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:38,630
But there's no stove.

584
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:40,060
Except for this

585
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,500
Like hold on

586
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Can we pick up pizzas with this?

587
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,830
No we can't

588
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:49,200
What is this supposed to do?
Chicken: But you can knock everything off. Haha.

589
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,230
(Mel laughs)

590
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:59,000
Chicken: Bonk, bonk.
Wait, there's the pizza. Here's that pizza.

591
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,530
I found the pizza

592
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:06,130
Why can't we just pick up with our hands when it's done cooking?

593
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,790
Cause it's stiff.
Chicken: I don't fucking know.

594
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,160
It's stiff
Chicken: Stiff like my peepee.

595
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,660
(Mel pssh's)

596
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,130
(laughs) What the fuck!

597
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:17,260
The plate is just flying all over the place

598
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:19,560
What is going on anymore?

599
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,230
What?
Chicken: I don't know.

600
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:24,900
Hold on can I just...

601
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,660
Nope

602
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,930
Chicken: I can't even pick up the pizza and put it on the plate

603
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:33,700
(Mel laughs)
Chicken: That's how bad this is

604
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,330
Oh my god

605
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:40,530
Chicken: Oh I picked up the tomato sauce.
How???

606
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:43,230
Chicken: I don't know.

607
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:49,760
(Mel lols)

608
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,130
My god

609
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,630
We're shuttering our business.

610
00:23:56,633 --> 00:24:01,200
New item unlocked!
Chicken: Bro, the pizza one is broken as fuck.

611
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,700
Let's see what we're getting in the loot box.

612
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:11,790
Ah yes, sci-fi glasses.

613
00:24:12,466 --> 00:24:14,630
What else?

614
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,090
Hot doggers

615
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:17,230
Are they shoes?

616
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,590
Tell me they're shoes

617
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,900
Oh my god they are shoes

618
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,510
He heh.

619
00:24:22,516 --> 00:24:23,700
Available items

620
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,960
Let's see what they have...

621
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:25,710
Oh my god

622
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:29,540
Chicken: Fish shoes, lets go!
They have balaclavas

623
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:32,880
(StreetmanTV's Balaclava On The Beach)
Balaclava on the beach

624
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,400
Balaclava on your bitch

625
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,360
(Giggles)

626
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:40,590
The pizza was genuinely a shit show honestly

627
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:42,790
Chicken: You can't even put it on the plate

628
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,060
Chicken: It just...
Yeah it's fucking unplayable

629
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,000
Chicken: It just spazzes out and goes to the shadow realm

630
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,460
Jesus

631
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:50,230
Right let's try-

632
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:52,760
Let's try Freddy's fried chicken

633
00:24:52,766 --> 00:24:54,830
Chicken: Let's see if we fuck this one up

634
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,590
(Giggles)

635
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,660
Right uh...four piece nugget menu

636
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:01,660
So that means four nuggets and the fries

637
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:05,530
So... Fries

638
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,430
Wha-

639
00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:12,130
Come on last one

640
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:14,230
Cook already

641
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,860
There we go

642
00:25:15,866 --> 00:25:17,560
Four nuggets done

643
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:21,000
Right... um...

644
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:24,200
We're supposed to have it on the tray like this

645
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,400
Wait, is it possible for us to dump it out?

646
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,130
Oh yes, we can!

647
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:28,700
We just right click it

648
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,080
Chicken: Nice!

649
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,090
That's easy

650
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:36,260
Fries are cooked, so that means we can serve it to this guy

651
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:39,160
Nice

652
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,460
Okay what's next

653
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:42,090
Two piece nuggets

654
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:42,830
30 seconds left

655
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,000
Chicken: I'm making the two piece nuggets

656
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,230
30 seconds left come on

657
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:47,560
We should pre-made those fries

658
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:49,700
We should have pre-made those fries honestly

659
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,030
Chicken: I did

660
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:52,090
Nice

661
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,260
I mean nuggets sorry

662
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:54,560
Not the fries

663
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:57,090
You can't move these tray- these plates

664
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,930
Damn...

665
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,090
What is-

666
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:03,900
Why- why is it so yellow?

667
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,090
Chicken: Who knows, It’s chicken

668
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:09,560
Is this chicken with gonorrhea or something?

669
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:10,590
It'll be fine I guess

670
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:12,000
It'll be fine

671
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,730
Wait, does it work if it's just on the plate?

672
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:17,160
Yes it does

673
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,900
We don't need to stack those burgers at all

674
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,930
Chicken: Yep

675
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:22,930
Chicken: We're out of nuggets

676
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:23,930
Oh shit!

677
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:26,360
We gotta call for them nuggets

678
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:27,830
I got- I got a genius idea

679
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,460
Don't even bother using those trays

680
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:31,660
Just use your hands

681
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:32,460
Chicken: Lmao

682
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,200
(Fryer beeps twice)

683
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,010
I'm gonna do some cooking

684
00:26:36,016 --> 00:26:37,400
(Fire alarm beeps)

685
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,830
Chicken: Wait what's burning?
Oh shit

686
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:39,760
Uh... Nuggies

687
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:42,000
Don't worry about that

688
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:46,860
The restaurant won't burn if- if- if- if no burning logic exists

689
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:49,430
Oh I know what these food trays are for now

690
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:50,660
Chicken: What?

691
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:54,030
It's for transfer of pre- pre-done stuff

692
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:55,400
I figured it out now

693
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,500
Chicken: Nice!

694
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,260
Don't distract me

695
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:02,930
Chicken: What's burning?
Whatever happened here-

696
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:05,400
I genuinely don't know what's burning

697
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,230
Air is burning

698
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:08,130
That's all I can tell

699
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:11,630
"Something's gonna want someone burnt." -Melori, 2024

700
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:13,260
Chicken: I'm helping

701
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:15,260
(Laughs)

702
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,000
Ohhh! this is what's burned, okay

703
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,230
Chicken: What?

704
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:21,160
Nuggie

705
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22,790
Chicken: I see.

706
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,760
Chicken: Oh shit

707
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,960
Chicken: Where did it go?

708
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,330
♪ Where did it come from? ♪

709
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,130
♪ Where did it go? ♪

710
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:30,630
♪ Where did it come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe ♪

711
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:32,700
razioff (in nugget form): gedagedigedagedo-

712
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,730
Oh a single piece of nuggie

713
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:35,930
Okay

714
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:38,400
Chicken: Chicken borgar
Fries~!

715
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,360
Eeghhh

716
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:41,760
Get out of the way

717
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:42,700
Damn it

718
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,230
How are we doing is the first question

719
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:48,130
Not mentally well
Chicken: Oh, we’re probably doing terribly.

720
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,930
(Giggles)
Chicken: I think we’ve lost money

721
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,130
Chicken: heh

722
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:53,030
We clearly have

723
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:55,500
Yeah we haven't made burgers either

724
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,590
'cause we're out of burger patties

725
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,500
Wait hold on, did you check the truck?

726
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,900
Chicken: Uh... I haven't taken the stuff from the truck yet

727
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,500
There should be some-

728
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,660
There should be some...

729
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:08,580
Some patties there that we've ordered

730
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,290
(Steam achievement sound)

731
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:11,860
Cook 100 ingredients

732
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:13,630
Cool, game, cool.

733
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:16,030
Nuggies~!

734
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:20,200
(Laughs)
Chicken: Owh fuck.

735
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,760
It will be fine

736
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:28,590
Chicken: All is well, heh

737
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,660
All is well, all is well, all is well!

738
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,530
“Rancho”: However big the problem is,

739
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:37,790
“Rancho”: Just tell your heart "All is well".

740
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,580
Raju: Hmph.

741
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,360
(Back to ya regular programming)

742
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:41,900
Chicken: This is already a horrible...

743
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,230
It's a horror show

744
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:47,030
Chicken: It's a shitshow, that’s what it is.

745
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:48,630
Yeah, it'll be fine.

746
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:50,960
It's not like it's gonna explode this whole restaurant

747
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:52,360
Chicken: ♪ Till the very next day~ ♪

748
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:54,930
Mel & Chicken & Bryant: ♪ Pom, pom, pom, pom, pom, badam. ♪

749
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,360
This just speeds up cooking you know

750
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:59,700
This just speeds up cooking
Chicken: I’m sure it does.

751
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,630
Chicken: We need more nuggets

752
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:03,290
Chicken: We're missing nuggets

753
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:04,460
Shit

754
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:06,000
Chicken: Get me more nuggets

755
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,560
We need more people

756
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:10,160
Chicken: We need more slaves.

757
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,830
Pssh...

758
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,330
Okay I think I think we figured things out

759
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:18,030
At this point we should by now figure things out

760
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:20,560
for our next attempt.

761
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:24,590
Oh, you can click on them, okay.

762
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,730
That's fine

763
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:26,790
It's fine

764
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,030
Everything's fine...
Chicken: Oh god...

765
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:31,260
Everything's fine

766
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:32,830
Let's restart, let's restart.

767
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:33,900
I think we figured this out

768
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,160
I think we figured it out

769
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:40,730
Chicken: We figured out how to fuck ourselves over. That’s what we figured out.
(Giggles)

770
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:43,660
We made a profit of negative hundreds

771
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:45,060
(Giggles)

772
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:47,560
Okay so,so,so let's figure it out

773
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:49,160
I mean let's think about the strategy

774
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:50,730
So what I'm gonna do is we're gonna put some-

775
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:51,430
We're gonna put those-

776
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:53,430
Put nuggies in the tray

777
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:56,560
In the grill thingy or the fryer

778
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:58,200
Put them put them in the fryer tray first

779
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,400
Then we put them in the fryer

780
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,330
And after that we dump it onto those re-

781
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:05,200
Those static red red trays that we cannot move

782
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,700
These will be our prep table

783
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,030
Chicken: Nice, all right let's go

784
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:12,400
Let's go

785
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:16,400
Right... I'm dropping them nuggies in

786
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,790
Chicken: Chicken burger

787
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,090
Oh shit!

788
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:29,790
Whatever I'll figure it out later

789
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:34,130
(Giggles)

790
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,960
There's an oddly specific piece of-

791
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:39,160
Of patty that's not done

792
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,830
I'm gonna get that done first

793
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,530
Okay what are we short of right now

794
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:44,030
I need-

795
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:45,960
Tell me what I need to cook first

796
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:48,330
Chicken: Ehh, more patties

797
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,090
Patties okay

798
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,930
Oh my god this physics...

799
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,560
Okay, nuggets in

800
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:57,700
Chicken: Oh, we need more fries

801
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,400
Okay, just drop this baby in first

802
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:04,060
Oh shoot

803
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:05,290
Chicken: We need more...

804
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:07,590
Chicken: ...we need more of everything

805
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,090
Everything?

806
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:11,460
Chicken: Yes
♪ Anything and everything all the time ♪

807
00:31:11,466 --> 00:31:15,430
Why can't they let us dump from the box straight?

808
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,460
Chicken: Who knows.

809
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:19,900
Chicken: Nice

810
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,290
Oh that's smooth

811
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,430
That throw was smooth

812
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:27,760
Chicken: “Served 50 perfect dishes to customers” achievement get.

813
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:29,860
Nice

814
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,290
Oh my god, please, game, please...

815
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,830
Let's see what are the boxes

816
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:38,930
I'll chuck these out

817
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:40,400
I'll get to you later

818
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,430
Anymore? Nothing here.

819
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,760
I'll tend to you later

820
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:52,530
Chicken: Welp, I found a very efficient way to put the bun, that the burgers in.

821
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:55,000
What, just throw it onto the tray?

822
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,530
Chicken: Throw the bun on (to the tray)

823
00:31:56,533 --> 00:32:00,930
Chicken: Take a knife, chop it, and then just bring it (to the customer).

824
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:02,730
Done

825
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:04,430
Fries and nuggies

826
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:05,360
Okay

827
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:06,930
Oh, come on!

828
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:10,030
(Laughing in panic)

829
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,160
Chicken: Chop

830
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:17,760
I hit my hand and, at least half of the nuggies that we’re in a tray, went into the trashcan!

831
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:22,060
Chicken: Well done. You’ve done well, my friend.
(Laughing)

832
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:24,160
What is with all these

833
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,930
What is with all these accidents with me!

834
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:29,290
Chicken: Well done my friend

835
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:30,160
You're welcome

836
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:31,790
(Laughs)

837
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,060
At least we got a spare box which is a good thing

838
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:35,130
(Laughs)

839
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:36,630
Chicken: Wait, where's the knife...?

840
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:37,400
(Laughs)

841
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,290
Chicken: The knife is missing

842
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,200
Chicken: Can we order a knife?

843
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,400
(Laughs)
No

844
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,630
Chicken: Owh, I found it.

845
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,130
Chicken: Fries, patties, holy shit. Everything went flying!
(Laughs)

846
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,130
Chicken: O, shit!

847
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:55,090
One nuggie came to me!
(Laughs)

848
00:32:56,033 --> 00:33:00,030
There's one nuggie right here!

849
00:33:00,033 --> 00:33:02,930
Okay calling calling upon everything

850
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:05,590
Chicken: Calling upon God and Anime

851
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:07,630
(Laughs)

852
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:09,530
Oh my god

853
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,900
Game, please don't do this to me.

854
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,930
Patty is good

855
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:16,400
Chicken: Nice

856
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,960
Stop picking up the box

857
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:22,500
Game, stop picking up the box.

858
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,330
Chicken: The trays are flying everywhere

859
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,060
Chicken: They've gone rogue

860
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:28,830
They've gone sentient

861
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:31,260
I hear the fries done so

862
00:33:31,266 --> 00:33:33,400
Oh!

863
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:35,860
Chicken & Mel: Three star?

864
00:33:35,866 --> 00:33:38,060
Chicken: You gotta be kidding me.

Chicken: Ahh yes, I'm sure we won't fuck this one up here

873
00:33:50,866 --> 00:33:52,560
Why do we need to cook the taco shells

874
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:55,200
Oh wait, whatever.

875
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,960
Oh wow, that's fast.

876
00:33:56,966 --> 00:33:58,760
Chicken: Two chicken tacos.
Where do we get chicken from

877
00:33:58,766 --> 00:34:02,090
Oh...here chicken breast

878
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:03,090
Mexi chicken bowl

879
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:05,290
How do you make chicken bowl that's the question

880
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:07,060
Chicken: I wonder

881
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:09,800
Chicken: Err, It’s one of everything
That I wonder till this

882
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,830
One of everything?

883
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,800
In a bowl

884
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,090
Chicken: I guess?

885
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:17,230
Chicken: Oh it's tortilla and all the...

886
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:22,900
Chicken: It's tortilla, chicken, avocado and tomato.

887
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,690
Okay

888
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,830
Uh... oh wow!

889
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:31,360
We need to slice things as tortillas as well

890
00:34:31,366 --> 00:34:34,300
This is the weirdest question I've ever ever wanted to ask

891
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,630
Why do we need to cook the chips as well

892
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:38,630
Chicken: I wonder

893
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:39,760
Onion

894
00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:42,630
We need to chop them so-

895
00:34:42,633 --> 00:34:44,330
What!?

896
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,930
What!?
Chicken: Lmaooo

897
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:48,230
That much!?

898
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,930
Oh my god this is a shit show

899
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:54,400
This this requires more people than we think

900
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,660
Chicken: Damn this is crazy

901
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:59,530
Yep, that's crazy.

902
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:01,260
(Fire alarm beeps)

903
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,530
Wait what!?

904
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:05,630
How the fuck!?

905
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:08,500
These onions cook fast

906
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,360
Game, please.

907
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:15,500
(Fire alarm beep)

908
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,530
What!?

909
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,160
Okay, so, I think we're not supposed to cook the onions

910
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,930
We're supposed to just drop it in

911
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:25,160
Chicken: Damn

912
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:27,730
We're supposed to just drop her in

913
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:29,360
As-is

914
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:31,630
I assume this is what makes a-

915
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:34,360
What makes a taco

916
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:35,900
This isn't what I ordered

917
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,160
Ah shit...

918
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,660

How about you do the cooking this time?

961
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:56,330
Just like-

962
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:59,030
We'll just alternate positions every time

963
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:00,330
Chicken: Hm, alright

964
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:01,590
Like last time I was doing the cooking

965
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,590
And you were doing the prepping so

966
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,400
The rest is raw

967
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,500

00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,160

Fuck the pan

992
00:37:57,866 --> 00:38:01,130
If it cooks on grill, we'll do that.

993
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:02,430
Never mind

994
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:04,300

999
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:19,560

It'll be fine.

1005

Chicken: I'm worrying about it
Beef

00:39:08,466 --> 00:39:09,930
I know right

1023
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,130

1025
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:16,000

Holy shit

1027
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:19,900
Do you think Mexican food is just-

1028
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,150
Um...
Chicken: It's a nightmare

1029
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,860
A very stressful one

1030
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:25,530
Very needy of players

1031
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:28,360
Chicken: That one definitely needs four players

1032
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,260
Yep

1033
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,760

Let's see what we can do with the sandwiches

1037
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,060
Let's look at the ingredients

1038

That is ridiculously needy

1049
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,900
Chicken: Two ham, cheese

1050
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,560
The chef will need to rem-

1051
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:03,900
No, the prepper will have to remember a lot.

1052
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,930
Chicken: Damn, son.

1053
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:06,400
A lot...

1054
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,900
Let's cook the bread beforehand

1055
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,030
Let's get the bread done

1056
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,760
Chicken: Where the humans at?

1057
00:40:11,766 --> 00:40:14,160

Oh my god.
Chicken: WTF, how does that even happen?

1063
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:30,360
What's even going on there anymore?

1064
00:40:30,366 --> 00:40:32,960
We'll put the knife here so it'll be easier for you

1065

(Giggles)

1087
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,060
I feel like the fast food restaurant

1088
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:22,360

Chicken: What the fuck!

1091
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,150
Why can't we dump shit from the box?

1092
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,760
I feel like this really needs a lot of people

1093
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:35,060
Chicken: Yeah

1094
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:36,260
Chicken: It's crazy

1095
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:39,130
This is one of those where it actually needs a lot of people

1096
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:41,660
Under this crazy cramped space

1097
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,730
Chicken: Y'know, this would be so much easier in real life.

1098
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:47,930
Yeah, it would be way easier in real life, honestly.

1099
00:41:47,933 --> 00:41:51,030
Even if it's one-handed, it'll be easier in real life still.

1100
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:53,230
Chicken: Indeed

1101

00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:02,430
There we go

1105
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:05,530
Chicken: Wha... it burns SO FAST!

1106
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:06,690
(Giggles)

1107
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:09,190
Chicken: It burned faster than my future

1108
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:11,810
(Laughs)

1109
00:42:11,816 --> 00:42:14,330
When your future is in shambles

1110
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,880
Ham and cheese

1111
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:19,360
Yeah, we this will definitely need a whole lot of people.

1112
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:21,030
Also the floor is burning

1113
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:22,830
My god...
(Steam achievement)

1114
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,230
"Put out 50 fires", yes.

1115
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:27,430
Chicken: God damn it, IT’S FLYING EVERYWHERE!

1116
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:28,530
(Giggles)

1117
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:30,500
Chicken: We've already failed man, heheheh.

1118
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,230
Yep, we absolutely failed.

1119
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:36,190
Wait the customer satisfaction is still okay though

1120
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:39,800
There's no bad face on the on the word though

1121
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,930
Chicken: Oh, it's a sad face now.

1122
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:45,830
Okay, that's when we probably lost.

1123
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:50,060
Oh, thanks for driving off.

1124
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:55,130
Haven't even took the cucumber and they drove off already, god damn it.

1125
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,500
We got all in control.

1126
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,330
Chicken: Do we?

1127
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,190
No

1128
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:05,050
Chicken: This is absolutely terrible

1129
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,280
Chaos

1130
00:43:07,283 --> 00:43:08,690
Oh shit

1131
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:12,280
Chicken:God damn it!
(Mel laughs)

1132
00:43:12,283 --> 00:43:15,680
Chicken: We ain't getting anything out.
(Mel laughs)

1133
00:43:17,566 --> 00:43:21,110
Wait, there's a cooked chicken breast here.

1134
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,430
Oh.
Chicken: God damn it.

1135
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:27,780
Hey, one star.  We got something.
Chicken: One star.

1136
00:43:27,783 --> 00:43:29,480
Chicken: Yeah, but we still lost money.

1137
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:31,510
(Laughs)

1138
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:33,560
Okay, you want to try the next one?

1139
00:43:33,566 --> 00:43:34,430
Chicken: Sure

1140
00:43:34,433 --> 00:43:36,910
Issac's Ice Cream Shop.

1141
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:39,860
Chicken: Nice. Surely this one's easy.

1142
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:42,910
Yeah, this one says 1-2 person though so.

1143
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:45,810
I think we should do fine.

1144
00:43:46,066 --> 00:43:46,980
I think we'll do fine

1145
00:43:46,983 --> 00:43:50,750
Chicken: Oh, it even says the number of players required? God damn it.

1146
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,930
Yeah, it does say so.

1147
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,360
Coffee and strawberry

1148
00:43:58,366 --> 00:43:59,410
You got the wrong...
Chicken: Is that it?

1149
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,930
...you gave him chocolate.

1150
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:04,430
Chicken: Never mind, I'll do the left side, you do the right side.

1151
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:08,900
Okay. Uh, your spoon's over there, way over there.

1152
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,030
Chicken: God damn it.

1153
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,430
Raspberry

1154
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:15,190
Rasp

1155
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:17,360
(Chicken Disco)

1156
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:19,180
Hello

1157
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,010
"Can't wait to eat this"

1158
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,940
(Laugh) That worked.
Chicken: Heheh, magic, magic.

1159
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:30,750
Chicken: Why are they not coming to the left side?

1160
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,110
Blueberry
Chicken: I'm free.

1161
00:44:32,116 --> 00:44:33,830
Blueberry and vanilla...
Chicken: I'm free.

1162
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:34,800
You know what?

1163
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,650
Hold on

1164
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,660
Yeah, we do that.

1165
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:41,150
Oh, you double layered it.

1166
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:44,080
Chicken: I didn't know how you put it on.

1167
00:44:44,966 --> 00:44:48,650
They're all lining up in one- Oh, there's the other side.

1168
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,030
But he's not coming forward

1169
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:52,980
Bro, are you okay?

1170
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:55,480
Oh well, someone just cut in line.

1171
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:57,730
So we just serve it like that?

1172
00:44:57,733 --> 00:45:01,810
Chicken: Hehahah, I gave him an ice cream-less cone!

1173
00:45:01,816 --> 00:45:04,060
Chicken: Let's go

1174
00:45:04,066 --> 00:45:06,430
Uh, we're out of cone.

1175
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:08,000
Chicken: Yeah.

1176
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,310
Can't I just spoonfeed you the ice cream?

1177
00:45:10,316 --> 00:45:13,010
(Laughs)

1178
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,660
I think the fast food service is for us

1179
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:16,810
Chicken: Some cones are left behind!

1180
00:45:16,816 --> 00:45:19,730
Okay, we'll put the cones on the sides.

1181
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:21,780
Like this

1182
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:25,210
Chocolate

1183
00:45:25,216 --> 00:45:27,050
I'll just chuck them into the...

1184
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,810
I'll just chuck them into the freezer.

1185
00:45:29,816 --> 00:45:32,760
Then, we'll grab them when we need them.

1186
00:45:32,883 --> 00:45:35,660
How far are you throwing these things?
Chicken: Heh, wee~!

1187
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,110
Chicken: Oh, help help!

1188
00:45:37,116 --> 00:45:39,530
Chicken: The truck is sending me away! Arghh!

1189
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:41,110
Wait! The ice cream!

1190
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:45,340
They're going out of bounds. (Laughs)

1191
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:48,960
The ice creams are going out of bounds.

1192
00:45:50,766 --> 00:45:52,560
Okay, vanilla.

1193
00:45:52,566 --> 00:45:54,080
We will need a refill for that-

1194
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:56,230
Excuse me!

1195
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:58,080
Actually, I'll come back to you.

1196
00:45:58,083 --> 00:45:59,210
Actually, now think about it.

1197
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:01,580
I think it would be...

1198
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:04,110
more optimized if you do it alone.

1199
00:46:04,116 --> 00:46:05,410
Chicken: Yeap.

1200
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:07,660
When we run out of materials, I'll swap them out.

1201
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,130
Chicken: But how do you take them OFF the cone?

1202
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:12,080
Uh, right click.

1203
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,610
Owh, hahaha.

1204
00:46:16,116 --> 00:46:17,630
Oh, vanilla's out.

1205
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:20,730
Okay, let me just chuck in a new vanilla.

1206
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:22,460
Wait

1207
00:46:22,716 --> 00:46:25,210
I have a vanilla over there

1208
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:26,150
Right there

1209
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,410
Now just chuck it in like that

1210
00:46:28,416 --> 00:46:30,180
Wow okay

1211
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:31,010
That worked

1212
00:46:31,016 --> 00:46:32,840
Okay

1213
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:36,760
Let's see...
Chicken: Wow...

1214
00:46:36,766 --> 00:46:41,580
Whoa, okay.
Chicken: Wow, incredible.

1215
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:43,630
That's way better.
Chicken: The Ice cream is for us.

1216
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:45,500
Chicken: Ice cream business (is) for us.

1217
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,310
Yup

1218
00:46:47,316 --> 00:46:48,560
You want to try that again?

1219
00:46:48,566 --> 00:46:49,630
Chicken: Sure

1220
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:50,560
All right

1221
00:46:50,566 --> 00:46:51,530
Hold on

1222
00:46:51,533 --> 00:46:52,580
There's more other...

1223
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:54,180
There's more other stuff that you...

1224
00:46:54,183 --> 00:46:57,030
But they all require DLCs

1225
00:46:57,033 --> 00:46:59,760
Chicken: How much do they cost?

1226
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:02,760
I don't know but we'll check them after the video

1227
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:04,980
(Yeap, it's expensive. I'm not European)
(Vine boom)

1228
00:47:04,983 --> 00:47:07,030
What do you want to do this time for real?

1229
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,940
Chicken: I don't know.

1230
00:47:08,949 --> 00:47:10,090
Hot dogs maybe?

1231
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:11,150
And then

1232
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:12,460
Wait, "cook off"?

1233
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:14,710
Chicken: Cook-off? Ough.
"Compete against each other for coins"

1234
00:47:14,716 --> 00:47:17,650
Oh.
Chicken: Nice. What do the coins do?

1235
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:18,480
I wonder

1236
00:47:18,483 --> 00:47:21,830
Let's figure out how cook off works actually.

1237
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,840
"Waiting for players"
Chicken: We're just competing.

1238
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:24,810
Yup

1239
00:47:24,816 --> 00:47:25,800
Right, how do we check?

1240
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,030
How do we check the orders?

1241
00:47:27,033 --> 00:47:27,980
Hamburger

1242
00:47:27,983 --> 00:47:32,050
Okay, so we have to remember what everything is.

1243
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:32,900
Shit

1244
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,410
I'm glad we have went through this whole thing.

1245
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:38,730
Glad, we went through company training.

1246
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:41,060
Ha

1247
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,930
"You served your 1. dish"

1248
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:44,530
Okay, hot dogs next.

1249
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:46,690
Oh, there's no such thing as.
Chicken: God damn it, it's flying away.

1250
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:48,830
There's no such thing as dirty dishes

1251
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,110
That's good news

1252
00:47:50,116 --> 00:47:52,280
There's no cleaning involved.

1253
00:47:52,283 --> 00:47:53,630
Is there a cookbook?

1254
00:47:53,633 --> 00:47:56,460
There's no cookbook, that sucks.

1255
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:02,160
Third dish

1256
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:03,060
Hot dog

1257
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:04,660
Chicken: Bruh, it's flying away.

1258
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:06,030
Chicken: Where'd it go?

1259
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:07,060
Chicken: Huhh?

1260
00:48:07,066 --> 00:48:08,530
Chicken: Bruh

1261
00:48:08,533 --> 00:48:11,210
The good news is there's no cleaning involved

1262
00:48:11,216 --> 00:48:14,910
And the other good news, is that you don't even need to stack these things.

1263
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:15,860
Just serve them.
Chicken: Oh, nevermind.

1264
00:48:15,866 --> 00:48:17,810
Ayyyy

1265
00:48:17,816 --> 00:48:21,810
I can't do it because it's not letting me do it.

1266
00:48:22,183 --> 00:48:23,300
Oh, loot boxes

1267
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,480
Chicken: I'm getting scammed.

1268
00:48:25,483 --> 00:48:27,130
Midpart

1269
00:48:27,133 --> 00:48:29,530
Chicken: How dare you, you got bias.

1270
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:31,710
Pshh...

1271
00:48:31,716 --> 00:48:33,590
Round spectacles, okay.

1272
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,160
Chicken: Black sneakers and aviators

1273
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:41,230
Rainbow rounds, oh wow. Okay.
Chicken: Iron hat.

1274
00:48:43,816 --> 00:48:46,210
Black sneakers, okay.
Chicken: Midpart.

1275
00:48:46,216 --> 00:48:48,760
Right, let's dress up.

1276
00:48:50,566 --> 00:48:51,760
Okay

1277
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:53,860
I like to look the goofiest

1278
00:48:53,866 --> 00:48:55,380
The absolute goofiest

1279
00:48:55,383 --> 00:48:57,500
All right let's try out any other modes

1280
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,410
See if it's there...

1281
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:01,960
There's free play

1282
00:49:01,966 --> 00:49:04,000
Where there's no objectives

1283
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,230
But I don't think we'll ever want to do that.
Chicken: Hmm...

1284
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:08,680
So we'll just do another cook off then.

1285
00:49:08,683 --> 00:49:09,590
Let's try that again

1286
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,690
Chicken: What about One Armed Robber(y)?

1287
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:12,750
Maybe for another video

1288
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,460
Chicken: Ahh, I see.

1289
00:49:15,533 --> 00:49:16,900
Hamburger

1290
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,780
Hambagah
Chicken: I'm not in yet.

1291
00:49:18,783 --> 00:49:20,430
Wait, what?

1292
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:21,830
Chicken: For some reason.

1293
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,560
Wait, what the?

1294
00:49:23,566 --> 00:49:25,230
Okay, let's go back to the main menu.

1295
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:26,710
This game bugged out.

1296
00:49:26,716 --> 00:49:27,810
Chicken: Bruh.

1297
00:49:27,816 --> 00:49:30,060
That is so weird

1298
00:49:30,066 --> 00:49:31,780
Alright.
Chicken: Bruh. Let's go!

1299
00:49:31,783 --> 00:49:33,590
Let's go

1300
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,110
Are we in? Okay, good.
Chicken: Nice.

1301
00:49:35,116 --> 00:49:37,110
Hot dog

1302
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:52,260
Ooh.

1303
00:49:52,266 --> 00:49:56,310
Nice
Chicken: Nice, another hot dog.

1304
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,400
Nice.

1305
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,230
Cheeseburger

1306
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:04,530
Holy shit

1307
00:50:07,216 --> 00:50:09,280
Get sliced

1308
00:50:12,983 --> 00:50:14,910
Oh, nice.
Chicken: Eyy, let's go!

1309
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:16,930
GG.

1310
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:17,910
Oh

1311
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:19,300
Chicken: It's quite short though.

1312
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,360
Yeah, it is quite short.

1313
00:50:21,366 --> 00:50:23,180
Catering jobs
Chicken: There's no...

1314
00:50:23,183 --> 00:50:24,180
Wait, what?

1315
00:50:24,183 --> 00:50:24,940
Wait, hold on.

1316
00:50:24,949 --> 00:50:25,880
This is- Wait, hold on.

1317
00:50:25,883 --> 00:50:27,340
This is a...

1318
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:28,400
(Gasp)

1319
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,690
This is career mode.

1320
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:30,380
Hold on!

1321
00:50:30,383 --> 00:50:32,400
Chicken: And you can do it in multiplayer?

1322
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,460
Yeah, you can play it on multiplayer.

1323
00:50:34,466 --> 00:50:35,480
Holy shit.
Chicken: Nice.

1324
00:50:35,483 --> 00:50:36,460
Chicken: Let's go.

1325
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:37,960
Let's go

1326
00:50:37,966 --> 00:50:39,960
Oh, you can buy new recipes and stuff.

1327
00:50:39,966 --> 00:50:41,260
Okay so we start...

1328
00:50:41,266 --> 00:50:44,280
We start off with hot dogs.
Chicken: Fast feet, Rapid Rinse (Power-ups)

1329
00:50:44,283 --> 00:50:46,360
Serve 10 customers...
Chicken: We're broke.

1330
00:50:46,366 --> 00:50:48,830
While getting 10 out of 10...

1331
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,560
Without dropping any food on the floor

1332
00:50:50,566 --> 00:50:51,730
Don't drop any food on the floor

1333
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:52,860
Okay, gotcha.

1334
00:50:52,866 --> 00:50:55,410
Chicken: Nice, *instantly drops food on the floor*.

1335
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:56,940
Pssh...

1336
00:50:56,949 --> 00:50:59,360
Nope, we're not gonna do that.

1337
00:50:59,366 --> 00:51:01,460
Okay, hot dogs.

1338
00:51:01,466 --> 00:51:03,340
Uhh, normal hot dogs only.

1339
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:04,940
So we only need to make normal hot dogs.

1340
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:06,180
So, I think we're good.

1341
00:51:06,183 --> 00:51:09,050
(Windows XP Error)
Fatal error, crashed.

1342
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,050
Awh...

1343
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,380
Chicken: God damn it

1344
00:51:11,383 --> 00:51:12,300
Okay

1345
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,510
Honestly, this game is filled with content.

1346
00:51:14,516 --> 00:51:16,230
Despite being free.

1347
00:51:16,233 --> 00:51:18,560
Chicken: There's also paid content.

1348
00:51:18,566 --> 00:51:23,530
Yea,but free on its own is actually really really good.

1349
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:25,580
Okay, so...
Chicken: Ough, six hotdogs.

1350
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,860
Yeah, just six hot dogs.

1351
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:29,690
So I'm going to cook exactly only six hot dogs.

1352
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:31,580
Try not to touch the pan at all.

1353
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,330
There's only one pan.

1354
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:36,630
Which is quite a pity.

1355
00:51:36,633 --> 00:51:37,590
No, we dropped what...

1356
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,660
We dropped the food on the floor.

1357
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:41,880
Chicken: Your fault, not mine. Hehehe.

1358
00:51:41,883 --> 00:51:43,460
No, it flew out.

1359
00:51:43,466 --> 00:51:44,280
Okay so I think...

1360
00:51:44,283 --> 00:51:45,300
I think I figured it out

1361
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,310
Hold on, let's try that again.

1362
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:47,730
Let's try that again

1363
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:49,180
Chicken: You failure! (Pan bonks)

1364
00:51:49,183 --> 00:51:50,860
(Mel laughs)
Chicken: Heh, *bonk*.

1365
00:51:50,866 --> 00:51:52,560
I figured (laughs)

1366
00:51:52,566 --> 00:51:53,680
That bonk

1367
00:51:53,683 --> 00:51:56,280
That last second bonk

1368
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,960
I figured it out now

1369
00:51:58,966 --> 00:52:00,180
Oh, new challenge.

1370
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,280
Without dropping any food on the floor

1371
00:52:02,283 --> 00:52:04,410
Without starting any fires

1372
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:05,030
We'll do one-

1373
00:52:05,033 --> 00:52:07,760
Absolutely one pair at a time

1374
00:52:07,766 --> 00:52:10,980
So that we don't make it fly like crazy.

1375
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:13,810
Don't take that meat off.

1376
00:52:13,816 --> 00:52:15,590
Chicken: But it's on the stove

1377
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,080
What do you mean, it's on the pan.

1378
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:19,060
Chicken: No, the pan flew away (in my POV).

1379
00:52:19,066 --> 00:52:21,760
Heh? Where did it go?

1380
00:52:21,766 --> 00:52:23,900
Whoa

1381
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:26,780
It looks fine for me though

1382
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:27,900
No

1383
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,230
Ahh, we dropped it.

1384
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:38,650
Chicken: *stab stab stab* heheheh.
(Mel laughs)

1385
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:41,280
We have to keep clicking new challenges for that.

1386
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,250
Okay, 11 customers,

1387
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,130
We have to get 10 out of 10...

1388
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:46,690
From every customer

1389
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:48,360
Wait what, satisfaction?

1390
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:50,010
No dropping food on the floor.

1391
00:52:50,016 --> 00:52:51,000
Okay

1392
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,340
The stove for my POV is fine.

1393
00:52:53,349 --> 00:52:55,050
So don't get any...

1394
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:56,830
Don't take anything off of me

1395
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,900
(Windows XP Error)
Chicken: Oh, fatal error.

1396
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,130
Ah, dang it.

1397
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:02,780
This game can sometimes be a little frustrating.

1398
00:53:02,783 --> 00:53:03,780
Chicken: Yep

1399
00:53:03,783 --> 00:53:05,440
Okay, I'm gonna do the...

1400
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,360
I'm gonna do the cooking.

1401
00:53:07,366 --> 00:53:09,250
And then you do the prepping.

1402
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,030
Chicken: Alright

1403
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:13,400
No!

1404
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,810
Chicken: God damn it, it flew away.
(Mel laughs)

1405
00:53:16,983 --> 00:53:18,660
Let's try that again.

1406
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:21,030
Chicken: God damn it.
(Mel laughs again)

1407
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:23,330
Chicken: Cringe.

1408
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:26,680
Chicken: All that for $22.

1409
00:53:27,849 --> 00:53:29,360
Mr.Krabs hired us

1410
00:53:29,366 --> 00:53:31,080
Simple to say

1411
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:35,090
Chicken: On my screen, the pan is on the floor.

1412
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:36,460
Nope, it's fine.

1413
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:38,090
The pan's fine.

1414
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:39,550
I'm gonna put the...

1415
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,130
I'm gonna put the bun in...

1416
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:45,310
Clear of of any knives.

1417
00:53:45,316 --> 00:53:50,110
To make sure that that it's not crazy.

1418
00:53:50,116 --> 00:53:53,210
We're just working like factory robots now

1419
00:53:53,216 --> 00:53:54,960
Chicken: Yep.

1420
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:57,360
Woah... (breathes heavily)

1421
00:53:57,366 --> 00:53:59,160
Chicken: You almost dropped something?!?!

1422
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:00,710
Almost

1423
00:54:00,716 --> 00:54:03,340
I grabbed the pan.

1424
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:07,880
The pan was almost going crazy.

1425
00:54:07,883 --> 00:54:09,530
Chicken: Only one more.

1426
00:54:09,533 --> 00:54:12,330
There's only one left

1427
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:14,110
No!
Chicken: God damn it.

1428
00:54:14,116 --> 00:54:15,530
God damn it!

1429
00:54:15,533 --> 00:54:17,430
(Mel hitting her desk)
Chicken: Hehe, the very last one.

1430
00:54:17,433 --> 00:54:19,940
(laughs) FUCK!

1431
00:54:19,949 --> 00:54:21,610
Chicken: Bro...

1432
00:54:21,616 --> 00:54:24,330
Remember, no rushing.

1433
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:27,150
Oh, this is stress inducing.

1434
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:31,800
Chicken: Hehe.
This is truly stress inducing.

1435
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,730
(Chicken & Mel laughing, losing it.)

1436
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:38,510
We had to like watch each other's steps

1437
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:41,710
To make sure we don't fuck this up.

1438
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:43,900
Chicken: Slow and steady now.

1439
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,630
Yes, steady.

1440
00:54:45,633 --> 00:54:48,710
Just steady~

1441
00:54:48,716 --> 00:54:52,480
Just keep it real steady.

1442
00:54:54,516 --> 00:54:56,710
Why is that...
Chicken: Wooh!

1443
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:58,560
I was wondering why the-

1444
00:54:58,566 --> 00:55:02,250
Why was the bread floating midair.

1445
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,380
Is this the last one?
Chicken: 'Right.

1446
00:55:05,383 --> 00:55:07,580
Chicken: I think so.

1447
00:55:08,966 --> 00:55:12,010
Chicken: Let's gooooo.
Yesh!!!

1448
00:55:12,016 --> 00:55:13,530
Yes!
Chicken: LET'S GOOOOO!

1449
00:55:13,533 --> 00:55:15,780
Finally~
Chicken: LET'S GOOOOO!

1450
00:55:15,783 --> 00:55:17,250
Oh my god.
Chicken: TWENTY DOLLARS!

1451
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,780
Chicken: LET'S GO! TWENTY DOLLARS!

1452
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,510
Twenty dollars.
Chicken: LET'S GOOOO!

1453
00:55:22,516 --> 00:55:24,380
Wait, 10 dollars.
Chicken: My share, zero dollars.

1454
00:55:24,383 --> 00:55:26,840
Oh my god, we share that?

1455
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:29,830
Chicken: We shared 0 dollars.

1456
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:33,090
Wait, why is dropping food...

1457
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:35,310
Why is dropping food on red?

1458
00:55:35,316 --> 00:55:36,660
What happened?

1459
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,430
Chicken: Who knows.

1460
00:55:38,433 --> 00:55:41,530
Oh, we need 25 dollars to unlock the new location.

1461
00:55:41,533 --> 00:55:43,730
So we have to keep repeating that...

1462
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:46,500
Until we get it.

1463
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,230
We got spare ingredients.

1464
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:53,310
Eyy, max reviews.

1465
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:57,480
(In the tune of Queen - Don't Stop Me Now)
Don't stop believing~

1466
00:55:58,099 --> 00:56:01,560
Cut the fucking hotdogs.

1467
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,030
We're burning them fries~

1468
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:05,660
Wait, actually I don't know what I'm talking about.

1469
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:07,830
I also don't.

1470
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,380
Don't stop believing

1471
00:56:11,383 --> 00:56:11,860
We-

1472
00:56:11,866 --> 00:56:12,760
I believe

1473
00:56:12,766 --> 00:56:15,430
I believe we can do this.

1474
00:56:15,483 --> 00:56:17,930
I will show you the power of believing.

1475
00:56:17,933 --> 00:56:18,930
(Reference)
Cyanide: Why do you not believe?

1476
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:19,810
Cyanide: Why do you not believe?

1477
00:56:19,816 --> 00:56:21,380
Cyanide: I will show you the power of believing.

1478
00:56:21,383 --> 00:56:22,910
Cyanide: I believe I'm going to kill this man.

1479
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:23,910
(Cyanide misses catastrophically)

1480
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:24,880
Cyanide: No!

1481
00:56:24,883 --> 00:56:25,730
(Womble laughs)

1482
00:56:25,733 --> 00:56:27,150
(Thank you SovietWomble for making genuine memories.)

1483
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,560
Prep that

1484
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:31,260
Serve it

1485
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:31,940
Chicken: Nice.

1486
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:33,000
Ayy

1487
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,130
Chicken: Let's go.

1488
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,630
No

1489
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:40,680
(Chicken laughs)

1490
00:56:40,683 --> 00:56:42,750
Oh, that was a close one.

1491
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:46,650
Chicken: The light flashed before your eyes. Hehe.
(Mel laughs)

1492
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:50,090
My entire life flashed before my eyes

1493
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:51,760
NO!!!

1494
00:56:51,766 --> 00:56:53,000
Nani??

1495
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,090
Chicken: What did you do???

1496
00:56:54,099 --> 00:56:56,010
(Mel screams in agony)

1497
00:56:56,016 --> 00:56:58,380
Chicken: What did you dooo???

1498
00:56:58,383 --> 00:57:01,160
The pan flew!

1499
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:02,550
Chicken: What did you doooo???

1500
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,440
The pan flew!

1501
00:57:04,449 --> 00:57:07,010
(Mel slams her desk)
Chicken: What did you doooo?

1502
00:57:07,016 --> 00:57:10,480
We were so close to passing the challenge

1503
00:57:10,483 --> 00:57:11,880
Chicken: You are cringe.

1504
00:57:11,883 --> 00:57:12,930
Okay, that's fine.

1505
00:57:12,933 --> 00:57:15,150
Because we have unlocked a new recipe.

1506
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:18,300
We've unlocked the hamburger.

1507
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,340
Oh my god, I don't want to do this.

1508
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:22,510
No, fuck you.

1509
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:24,840
Let's do this instead

1510
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:25,860
I don't want to do the challenge.

1511
00:57:25,866 --> 00:57:27,500
It's actually stressful.

1512
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,480
It's stressing me the fuck out.
Chicken: It's cringe.

1513
00:57:29,483 --> 00:57:30,810
It's actually-
Chicken: It's cringe.

1514
00:57:30,816 --> 00:57:32,810
It's actually stressing me the fuck out

1515
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:33,250
Wait, hold on.

1516
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,430
I forgot to invite you

1517
00:57:34,433 --> 00:57:35,310
Holy crap.

1518
00:57:35,316 --> 00:57:36,980
Chicken: I know.

1519
00:57:36,983 --> 00:57:39,110
Chicken: I'm still waiting.

1520
00:57:39,116 --> 00:57:41,400
Okay, here you go.

1521
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,000
The pay is $63 for 9 hamburgers.

1522
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,680
Chicken: Wow, an upgrade.

1523
00:57:47,683 --> 00:57:50,610
Yep, a significant one too.

1524
00:57:50,616 --> 00:57:53,000
I have figured out ways to optimize this...

1525
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,580
the usage of this pan.
Chicken: Fatal error.

1526
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:57,110
Ahh

1527
00:57:57,116 --> 00:57:58,590
Denny's diner

1528
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:02,380
Chicken: Multiplayer catering is so broken.

1529
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:07,360
The proper multiplayer is better by a long shot.
Chicken: Yeap.

1530
00:58:07,366 --> 00:58:09,060
Chicken: Yeap

1531
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:14,710
Yes

1532
00:58:14,716 --> 00:58:15,980
Touch my face with it.

1533
00:58:15,983 --> 00:58:16,710
Yes

1534
00:58:16,716 --> 00:58:17,630
Chicken: Bruh.

1535
00:58:17,633 --> 00:58:20,090
Very the nice.

1536
00:58:20,483 --> 00:58:23,090
It's a salmonella simulator

1537
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,910
Chicken: Bruh.

1538
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,630
Chicken: Where (are) da buns?!?!

1539
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:28,910
It'll be fine.

1540
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:31,080
Oh, shit!

1541
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:34,510
That's fine.
Chicken: Stick it in the sink!

1542
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,980
Chicken: The sink is burning!

1543
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,190
God damn it.

1544
00:58:43,516 --> 00:58:46,560
It's fine, we're not doing the challenges.

1545
00:58:46,633 --> 00:58:48,610
Chicken: More flying away!

1546
00:58:48,616 --> 00:58:51,080
♪ Fly away, fly away~ ♪

1547
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:53,660
Chicken: Where's the patty?

1548
00:58:53,983 --> 00:58:54,960
Chicken: Oh, it's there.

1549
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:57,000
Patty~

1550
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,310
I think this would actually be a perfect vtuber collab game.

1551
00:59:01,316 --> 00:59:01,930
Chicken: I guess so

1552
00:59:01,933 --> 00:59:06,400
Because of the insane chaos

1553
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,410
that ensues in this kitchen.
Chicken: It's insanity.

1554
00:59:08,416 --> 00:59:10,110
Chicken: It's insanity.

1555
00:59:10,116 --> 00:59:11,360
Truly one...

1556
00:59:11,366 --> 00:59:14,510
Truly one of the games of all time.

1557
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:18,860
Chicken: One more, only one more.

1558
00:59:18,983 --> 00:59:21,030
One bun

1559
00:59:25,816 --> 00:59:27,380
We don't even need to...

1560
00:59:27,383 --> 00:59:28,580
Chicken: Let's go~

1561
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:30,310
Let's go

1562
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:33,210
Chicken: Just throw them all in a plate.

1563
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:34,940
Yush.

1564
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:36,410
Oh my god

1565
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:40,660
Just because we're playing together it means that the pay is split

1566
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:44,230
Wait, you can upgrade the stoves as well.

1567
00:59:44,233 --> 00:59:45,180
Oh, power-ups.

1568
00:59:45,183 --> 00:59:46,630
Fast feet.

1569
00:59:46,633 --> 00:59:49,860
I think we can grind them off-camera or whenever we feel like it.

1570
00:59:49,866 --> 00:59:52,960
Because this is really grindy, this game.

1571
00:59:52,966 --> 00:59:54,010
Chicken: Indeed.

1572
00:59:54,016 --> 00:59:57,310
Yep, so you want to have a last...

1573
00:59:57,316 --> 00:59:59,280
Actually, you know what, let's go to the browse servers

1574
00:59:59,283 --> 01:00:01,780
and let's see who we can raid.

1575
01:00:01,783 --> 01:00:03,330
Chicken: I see.

1576
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,610
Let's go to wine... "winecrooked".

1577
01:00:06,616 --> 01:00:08,800
Oh, they're gonna have a cook-off

1578
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,260
winecrooked: play?

1579
01:00:10,266 --> 01:00:11,730
Yes

1580
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,910
Chicken: nYes

1581
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:17,400
Chicken: No la, just sit here and stare at this guy.

1582
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,410
Let's see if they...
Chicken: Moment of silence.

1583
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,440
Let's see if they're gonna actually play.

1584
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:23,810
Chicken: Oh.
Oh my god

1585
01:00:23,816 --> 01:00:26,380
Chicken: "Freddy's fried chicken"

1586
01:00:26,383 --> 01:00:28,480
I'll get them nuggies down

1587
01:00:28,483 --> 01:00:30,430
There's voice chat, by the way.

1588
01:00:30,433 --> 01:00:31,910
Chicken: Nice.

1589
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:34,080
And there's text chat.

1590
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:37,380
What the fuck is going on with the physics!

1591
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:40,430
The physics went ape shit.

1592
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:42,730
Yes mawi, go, put it in.

1593
01:00:42,733 --> 01:00:43,660
You can do this.

1594
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:45,260
That's right, in you go.

1595
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,230
I'll prep the patties.

1596
01:00:47,233 --> 01:00:50,030
Which should be here.

1597
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:54,260
Okay, patties are good.

1598
01:00:55,699 --> 01:00:58,630
Whatever the noise is, it's bothering me.

1599
01:00:58,633 --> 01:01:00,960
And getting me concerned as well.

1600
01:01:00,966 --> 01:01:05,400
I'm also wondering. Someone fappin', or something?

1601
01:01:09,316 --> 01:01:11,280
Oh my god.

1602
01:01:11,283 --> 01:01:13,380
These nuggies wouldn't budge.
Chicken: It's flying all over the place!

1603
01:01:13,383 --> 01:01:16,550
Chicken: It's flying all over the place!

1604
01:01:19,016 --> 01:01:19,730
I know what it is.

1605
01:01:19,733 --> 01:01:21,500
I know what's making that noise.

1606
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,580
The food tray.

1607
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:24,680
The food tray colliding against each other.

1608
01:01:24,683 --> 01:01:27,160
Chicken: Damn, that's pretty gay.

1609
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:28,930
Yep

1610
01:01:30,866 --> 01:01:32,610
No, why.
Chicken: Holy shit!

1611
01:01:32,616 --> 01:01:35,530
Don't collide with me god damn it

1612
01:01:35,533 --> 01:01:38,780
Chicken: On my screen, you're the one who went in front of me.

1613
01:01:38,783 --> 01:01:41,000
What the fuck.

1614
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,360
So yeah, we have proven that the fried chicken service is actually...

1615
01:01:45,366 --> 01:01:48,840
Actually best played with four people.

1616
01:01:48,849 --> 01:01:52,430
Chicken: Yeah. All of them are best played with four people.

1617
01:01:52,433 --> 01:01:53,940
We haven't...

1618
01:01:53,949 --> 01:01:57,930
We don't even know who the fuck these two others are.

1619
01:01:57,966 --> 01:02:00,050
Chicken: Chicken nuggies

1620
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,880
(In the tune of Bacon Pancakes from Adventure Time)

1623
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:15,030
Has anyone seen the knife?

1624
01:02:15,616 --> 01:02:18,430
Oh, I found the knife, I found the knife.

1625
01:02:18,616 --> 01:02:20,810
I found the knife.

1626
01:02:22,116 --> 01:02:24,330
I found it, I found it, I found it.

1627
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:26,180
Chicken: Nice.

1628
01:02:26,316 --> 01:02:28,880
Okay, I'll leave it here.

1629
01:02:28,883 --> 01:02:31,810
Chicken: Holy shit...
Get to work, get to work, get to work.

One, two...

1631
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:39,050
I went from cook to being the server.

1632
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:41,460
We have to put the nuggets in the general area.

1633
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:45,840
Some things are going crazy so please don't stack anything at all.

1634
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:50,800
Don't stack the cook ingredients under any circumstances.

1635
01:02:51,566 --> 01:02:52,880
Oh, come on.

1636
01:02:52,883 --> 01:02:54,340
Chicken: God damn it.

1637
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:56,280
A whole set of nuggies too.

1638
01:02:56,283 --> 01:02:58,080
What a waste.

1639
01:02:58,083 --> 01:03:00,000
Chicken: God damn it.

1640
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,110
Chicken: Is this just gonna go on until we run out of business?

1641
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:04,930
Yep

1642
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:08,860
Chicken: Do we make an absolute mess of ourselves?

1643
01:03:08,866 --> 01:03:14,430
Do we wanna not cook at all and see how they react to this?

1644
01:03:14,433 --> 01:03:16,530
Chicken: Lmao.

1645
01:03:16,533 --> 01:03:19,750
It'll be funny if we just leave them, you know.

1646
01:03:20,783 --> 01:03:23,410
Chicken: Welp, let's see.

1647
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,830
What if we just buy like all nuggets and just make us run our business that way?

1648
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:28,760
and just make us run our business that way?

1649
01:03:28,766 --> 01:03:30,940
Chicken: Damn.

1650
01:03:34,183 --> 01:03:37,660
Holy, you can only buy a limited amount of them.

1651
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:38,810
God damn it

1652
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:40,090
Chicken: At a time?

1653
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:41,440
Yep

1654
01:03:41,449 --> 01:03:43,030
Oh my god.

1655
01:03:43,033 --> 01:03:45,560
The nuggets are going all over the place.

1656
01:03:45,566 --> 01:03:47,660
In the box.

1657
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:49,500
Chicken: We need more nuggies!

1658
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,430
Nuggies are all on the floors
Chicken: WE NEED MOAR NUGGIES, NUGGIES!!!

1659
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:53,830
The nuggies are all on the floor!

1660
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:57,590
mawi stop stealing the damn fucking box!

1661
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:04,060
It's going all over the place.

1662
01:04:04,066 --> 01:04:05,430
That will do...

1663
01:04:05,433 --> 01:04:05,860
That will do-

1664
01:04:05,866 --> 01:04:07,910
Please move out of the way.

1665
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:10,300
Do you understand what latency means?

1666
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,830
Chicken: Hehe, (mockingly) nope.

1667
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:14,310
Okay

1668
01:04:14,316 --> 01:04:15,960
Oh, there we go.

1669
01:04:15,966 --> 01:04:17,960
Chicken: Finally, one star.

1670
01:04:17,966 --> 01:04:19,110
One star.

1671
01:04:19,116 --> 01:04:21,900
All that for one star.

1672
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,360
Chicken: God damn it.

1673
01:04:23,366 --> 01:04:26,530
My god.
Chicken: We are so bad.

1674
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:28,160
Indeed.

1675
01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:29,800
I can't even see the chat from here.

1676
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,310
What is going on?

1677
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:33,500
'Right

1678
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,610
I've left.

1679
01:04:35,783 --> 01:04:37,880
Phew.

1680
01:04:37,883 --> 01:04:39,810
Let's open up some more boxes.

1681
01:04:39,816 --> 01:04:42,460
Chicken: Loot box. What's in it?

1682
01:04:42,466 --> 01:04:43,860
Pink shorts.

1683
01:04:43,866 --> 01:04:46,410
That's it?
Chicken: Balaclava. Holy shit.

1684
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:47,830
Nice

1685
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:50,690
So, what have we learned from this game?

1686
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:52,300
Chicken: It's clunky.

1687
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,510
Yes

1688
01:04:53,516 --> 01:04:56,110
However, it's free.

1689
01:04:56,116 --> 01:04:59,630
Roblox announcer & Chicken: It's free!!!

1690
01:04:59,633 --> 01:05:01,610
Though, it is quite fun, I gotta be honest.

1691
01:05:01,616 --> 01:05:03,940
If you're playing with the right person, just like Overcooked.

1692
01:05:03,949 --> 01:05:05,330
So...
Chicken: Yeap.

1693
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:07,150
Yeap.

1694
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:08,430
So, if you do want to check it out.

1695
01:05:08,433 --> 01:05:09,830
Do check it out in the description below.

1696
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:14,280
And... this is my first ever gameplay video

1697
01:05:14,283 --> 01:05:17,060
that is recorded and not on stream.

1698
01:05:17,066 --> 01:05:20,160
So, I hope you enjoyed it.

1699
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,260

1700
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:23,780

1701
01:05:23,783 --> 01:05:25,030
Bye bye.
Chicken: Buh-bye~

1702
01:05:25,033 --> 01:05:27,430
Chicken: Bye!

1703
01:05:46,116 --> 01:05:48,030
SOSIG!
