1
00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:03,667
She's not really back, is she?

2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:05,834
That is, by the way of MeloriTensei,

3
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:08,667
who has previously announced hiatus,

4
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:11,256
but has never announced that she's back!

5
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:14,460
Which is pretty evident with her battery replacement stream.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,373
Sometimes, we wonder if she really is back!

7
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:22,163
However, we have exclusive information from The Tech Wizardess herself.

8
00:00:22,163 --> 00:00:24,327
And thus, we'll hand it over to Mel herself.

9
00:00:24,327 --> 00:00:25,467
Take it away!

10
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:26,517
Thanks, FalseMel.

11
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:28,785
First up, I got a brand new logo!

12
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:30,864
What do you think? Do you think it looks good?

13
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,176
Do you think it looks good-y good-y good-y?

14
00:00:33,176 --> 00:00:33,852
(chuckle)

15
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:36,961
I mean, we got a little, like a circle-y looking thing.

16
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,172
and a galaxy in the ring.

17
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,828
Kinda give out that Michael Jackson vibe, don't ya think?

18
00:00:41,828 --> 00:00:43,453
Lemme know in the (*comments) below.
(Oops, said "description" by habit XD)

19
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:46,975
And with that aside, I got a brand new links page!

20
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:53,960
Which is currently hosted on https://pincushion.etersia.moe/@MeloriTensei/ The reason why I'm moving out of my Carrd

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,517
is because I wanna bring up more customizability

22
00:00:56,517 --> 00:00:59,765
without having to worry about the element count limit.

23
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:04,047
So with that addition, it has given me more space to add a few social medias.
(Beep beep, unnecessary NSFW warning)

24
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:06,047
Including PCPartPicker

25
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:07,950
(Ahh~)
And a steamy social media~

26
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,950
Whatever happens there stays there.

27
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,750
Don't bring it over to YouTube.

28
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,249
And without the limit, allows me to add even more contexts onto each of the sections.

29
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:22,615
Say, for example, the donations section. More on that later. And if you're wondering where I got the template from

30
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:27,350
Do check out LinkStack, it's a whole new server that lets you selfhost this kind of thing.

31
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,434
Check it out on GitHub.

32
00:01:28,434 --> 00:01:33,709
With that aside, I've also decided to return to Ko-Fi and Throne for my donation platform.

33
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:39,338
And with that said, I've also enabled PayPal as my donation option for PayPal balance users.

34
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:44,984
To those using cards, please use Stripe (the one that is not PayPal) as an option.

35
00:01:44,984 --> 00:01:51,832
Because, then more money will get to me. Because PayPal takes a little bit more for transaction fees that will be taken off me.

36
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:56,317
And I've also included that context in the notes section as well, in case you forgot.

37
00:01:56,317 --> 00:02:02,091
And with moving back into Ko-Fi, it also mean I'm going to start making some more 3D wallpapers.

38
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:03,771
Very occasionally, however.

39
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:06,661
If you got any ideas, send them down in the (*comments) below.
(Really Mel, "description" again?)

40
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:09,786
and with more wallpapers, I've also decided to up the quality.

41
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:11,761
Which also means I'm moving out of Blender,

42
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:15,290
and to use Unity to make these wallpapers instead.

43
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,267
Because I think Unity is much more close to the aesthetics that my current model is.

44
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:23,189
However, I got plans to do something even more exciting.

45
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:32,057
Which is Unreal Engine 5. However, I'm waiting for colliders for this model to be fixed on in UE5 first before I can make wallpapers out of UE5.

46
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:33,182
More on that in the future.

47
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:37,431
And speaking of fixing my model, I've added a couple of additions to my model

48
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:42,000
that are very minute. You might have seen this in my [Got Impatient] video

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,949
Where my mouth can puff, and I can stick my tongue out.

50
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:48,193
In addition to that, I could also move my mouth sideways.

51
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:49,801
Although, very very little.

52
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:52,866
Now onto a different topic, I've heard your concerns.

53
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:57,857
"Uhh Mel? When's your Discord server? Do you have a Discord server? I wanna keep in touch with you."

54
00:02:57,857 --> 00:03:02,470
While I understand, however moderation is a daunting task for me.

55
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,799
Especially for someone who's doing everything on the channel, from top to bottom, all by myself.

56
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,497
So, I've been waiting for a moderator to be able to assist me on that.

57
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:14,326
However, if you've watched the recent streams,

58
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:17,194
you might have noticed that I may have found a moderator.

59
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:21,155
And I'm going to appoint them as my moderator for my Discord server.

60
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:24,992
And I'll eventually work on the Discord server when I finally have time to work on it.

61
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:28,031
While it doesn't mean that the Discord server is coming instantly,

62
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:31,014
it may take months, it may take even half a year.

63
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:33,682
But rest assured it is going to be in the works.

64
00:03:33,682 --> 00:03:38,241
And speaking of "being in the works", I've decided to step out of Twitter and Instagram.

65
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:42,997
Because of great concerns of the wildly changed TOS on Twitter.

66
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:47,415
While it would be quite devastating to lose network on the community on Twitter,

67
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:52,780
I've also decided to step out of it for various other reasons, to which I wish to not disclose.

68
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,634
"Uhh, Mel. Where would the updates come (from) then?"

69
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:56,523
Glad you asked.

70
00:03:56,523 --> 00:04:01,845
The updates are going to be now on YouTube Community Post and Bluesky for English.

71
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:04,907
And I also wanted to practice my Japanese skills a little bit.

72
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:11,334
So, I've also started writing a couple of important update posts, in full Japanese, on Misskey as well.

73
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,854
Do check those out on the page I mentioned earlier.

74
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:18,087
And on top of that, I've also decided to start mainly streaming on YouTube.

75
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:22,845
Albeit now that I'm on YouTube, I'm gonna be making lesser streams and more videos.

76
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,471
Because I honestly think making streams are quite taxing on me.

77
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:29,337
Especially for someone who has been doing everything alone.

78
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:32,259
While I'm not going to fall behind on the stream quality,

79
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:36,369
I am going to drop the frequency (*and) keep focusing on videos.

80
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:39,644
So hopefully you would keep in touch with me for future videos.

81
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:42,395
But it's not like I'm gonna stream once in a long while either,

82
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:45,803
I'm gonna try to keep the stream frequency of once a week,

83
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:47,505
Hopefully most of the time.

84
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:50,549
And with that said, I wanted to also expand my coverage

85
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:53,461
for certain interesting communities I may reach out to.

86
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:57,702
So, I've added localization to my channel in Chinese and Japanese.

87
00:04:57,702 --> 00:05:00,596
Though, I won't be adding subtitles to those languages just yet.

88
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:05,471
But they are in consideration, someday when I do have a translator that could help me on that.

89
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,892
And with all the changes mentioned,

90
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:09,001
I'm gonna take a short management hiatus

91
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:12,859
so I can rebuild my PC and actually get certain actual parts in (to the PC).

92
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:16,886
and tidy up the spaghetti town level cable management on my desk setup.

93
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:19,954
I'm really really sorry for more delays but this is gonna take

94
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:22,104
probably two to three weeks.

95
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:25,354
I'm gonna be managing more than just what I mentioned of the two.

96
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:29,998
I'll probably be taking care of tidying up my channels and everything, and my OBS.

97
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:34,685
To make sure everything stays up to date and none of which are abandoned.

98
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:38,324
And after all that, I'm really really sorry for the constant delays.

99
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:42,582
I hope to manage way better in the coming future and push more content out.

100
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:46,643
Though, with that said, while I'm gone, there's gonna be one video that I'm gonna be pushing out.

101
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:51,705
It's gonna be my very very first video that I've properly edited in 2024.

102
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:53,663
Here's a trailer, check it out!

103
00:06:33,864 --> 00:06:38,304
So, how do you think? Do you think it looks good? Lemme know in the comments below.

104
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:39,595
Back to you, FalseMel!

105
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:41,001
Thank you so much, Mel!

106
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,413
And that is all for today's episode!

107
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:46,757
As always, press like and subscribe if you want more content out of me.

108
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:47,917
And there'll be more.

109
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:50,866
MeloriTensei 2024 for you, soon!
