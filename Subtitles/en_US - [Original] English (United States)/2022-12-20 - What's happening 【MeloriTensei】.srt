1
00:00:00,483 --> 00:00:03,560
Previously on Hololive Error.

2
00:00:03,566 --> 00:00:06,930
Let's try to get the second ending.

3
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:19,930
Oh it's about god fucking damn time.

4
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,310
"Note from a certain-"

5
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:27,010
She's here.

6
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:29,830
Lights went out and I heard steps.

7
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,380
Who the fuck are you?!?!

8
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,460
Right?

9
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:38,460
WARGH?!

10
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:43,692
Woah!

11
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:46,000
What is she doing here?

12
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:48,932
Woah!

13
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:51,430
Okay, it's different now.

14
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:54,550
What is it this time?

15
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,310
Oh no.

16
00:00:56,316 --> 00:01:01,330
So this is everything together in one place.

17
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:07,380
What's going on?

18
00:01:07,883 --> 00:01:12,080
This is a whole lot different than the first run.

19
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:14,930
And there's a note here.

20
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,110
UWARGH!

21
00:01:17,483 --> 00:01:20,430
This is way different than I thought.

22
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:27,200
Woah.

23
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,560
Was this all...

24
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:37,480
just a dream?

25
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:41,930
She's here.

26
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,040
Woah.

27
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,900
Okay, fuck me, that.

28
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,760
I still don't understand.

29
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:56,110
I'm gonna relax, clear my head.

30
00:01:57,216 --> 00:02:06,580
This is not the end yet.

31
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:19,410
So today, the goal is going to be, we're gonna try to complete the third ending.

32
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:24,750
I hope this goes well.

33
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,960
So a while ago, I read up on the internet about

34
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:36,060
which chapter I should be in to get the third ending.

35
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:40,340
But I kind of read halfway and I thought,

36
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:43,902
"maybe I shouldn't do this".

37
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:46,710
Maybe I should go legit.

38
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:51,360
There was a tip that I read before I closed the tab though.

39
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:55,780
The tip says, investigate everything.

40
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:58,910
Like just discover, pick up everything.

41
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:02,930
When they meant everything, they meant everything.

42
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:07,080
Okay.

43
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:11,360
Best wishes to myself for this.

44
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:14,310
Here we go.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,910
Apparently you're allowed to walk back.

46
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:25,660
So if you do walk back, you might be able to find hints that might help.

47
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:30,180
So I'm gonna try to strive for that.

48
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:34,763
I've went two runs and I completely forgot about it.

49
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:37,480
Also one thing I did notice.

50
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,660
The man.

51
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:42,440
Us.

52
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,030
We're walking in such a hilarious motion.

53
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:49,190
Are you seein' thing?

54
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,130
Now let's do the final sanity check.

55
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:03,110
I did get all the picture though.

56
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:03,460
Thumbs up.

57
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:05,400
Nice.

58
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,500
For a second, I actually thought I saw a note here.

59
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,110
Cause I saw something like a little boxy thingy.

60
00:04:14,783 --> 00:04:17,960
I don't even know why it still gets me.

61
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:22,890
But I do know that the aesthetics of this place has turned into…

62
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:26,460
Past time Aogami.

63
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:32,960
Ah, there she is.

64
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:38,475
So the goal is to pick up every single note.

65
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:39,380
Right.

66
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:44,770
So this is the note that she dropped.

67
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,580
Chat: "Still we getting ending three so it doesn't matter here."

68
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:51,360
I forgot about that as well.

69
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:56,810
I swear I've forgotten about everything about my first and second run.

70
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,610
After one sleep.

71
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:04,830
The moment I sleep, I just completely forgot about the endings.

72
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:09,810
About everything I need to know about the lore of the game.

73
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:12,440
Now we walk up to her and she's gonna crawl up to us like…

74
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,660
BLBLBLBLBLBLBLBL.
Like Spider-Woman.

75
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,850
"Imagine the one voicing the guy is Yagoo"

76
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,060
YAGOO: Hello everyone.

77
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:29,960
Yagoo.

78
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:32,980
YAGOO: I am Motoaki Tanigo, CEO of COVER Corporation.

79
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:34,880
Chat: "To be fair, the model in the game is kinda eh.

80
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:36,830
But the story motive is pretty good."

81
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,580
Yeah, the model is pretty eh.

82
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:43,710
But, you know, Shino's model.

83
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:47,940
Pretty much is Tokino Sora but still.

84
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,260
Hella cute though.

85
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,780
Actually cute.

86
00:05:52,783 --> 00:05:54,860
Chat: "Wait till you see the cutscene of ending three.

87
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,780
The model there is so weird."

88
00:05:56,783 --> 00:05:57,610
Why is it?

89
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:58,530
No, actually you know what?

90
00:05:58,533 --> 00:05:59,750
Don't tell me anything.

91
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,880
That's what I wanna know but don't tell me.

92
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:04,173
Don't tell me anything.

93
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:06,360
Just yet.

94
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,800
Chat: "It should turn bloody first."

95
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,830
Yeah, the room should turn bloody first.

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,010
And here we are.

97
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:17,460
This is where it begins.

98
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:20,890
The crazy part is I'm actually kinda scared.

99
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:26,680
Even though I went through this path for like two, three times now.

100
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:29,030
And the chair should come out.

101
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:31,680
Just going wild.

102
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,095
And then there she is.

103
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,230
Spazzing out.

104
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:46,997
I still think it's kinda impressive, you know, when they make people spaz out.

105
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:49,780
Okay, we're allowed to go through there.

106
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:51,100
We're not-

107
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,930
Do not go to the art room.

108
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:59,560
Yeah, the room stops turning bloody.

109
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:05,660
What if I stop and go back?

110
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:07,760
Now that I have gone-

111
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:11,180
Chat: "go all the way to the end and then turn back."

112
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,260
But...

113
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:16,160
Okay, you know what?

114
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:22,560
Let's have one last look before we actually do go to the dead end.

115
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,580
I think.

116
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:27,610
See, I told you she's there.

117
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:28,810
Look at her.

118
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:32,050
What did I tell you?

119
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:40,780
Oh my god, I fucking called it.

120
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:45,010
Oh my god, that laugh though.

121
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:46,280
That smile and everything.

122
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:49,180
"If only I had the courage to stop them from back then,

123
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:50,910
none of this would have ever happened...

124
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:51,910
It's my fault...

125
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,860
they're all.

126
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,260
Right, now let's try...

127
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:59,730
So the next thing we have to take note of is Yuka's note.

128
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:05,730
Oooh okay, landslide happens again.

129
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,690
And they're all running.

130
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,510
Probably because of murder.

131
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,410
Murder~

132
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,480
Conductor: That's what a murderer...

133
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:21,130
MURDER

134
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:26,330
That one little detail I noticed...

135
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:32,940
Uhh, Cover Corp, you might want to take a little look at this.

136
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,540
Unless that's intentional.

137
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,430
Because the chair is in contact with the ground.

138
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:46,660
That table is in contact with the ground with the black part.

139
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:49,160
That chair.

140
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,830
That's black part of the table.

141
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,960
But this isn't in contact with anything.

142
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,610
It's floating literally.

143
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:02,260
Slight little oversight, but okay.

144
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:08,830
Look at her, she's so cute.

145
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:17,760
Wait, hold up!

146
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,630
That's a completely different line.

147
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:24,390
That's a completely different line.

148
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:31,060
Because because because usually she would say back to the time where.

149
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:35,530
Let's look at the corner to top right corner.

150
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,460
Because we're expecting a...

151
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:39,680
She's there!

152
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:44,850
She's there.

153
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:49,810
Not.

154
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,640
Why did you forget about that part?

155
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:03,380
Why did I forgot about that part?

156
00:10:22,016 --> 00:10:25,610
Holy shit, it's so neatly tidy.

157
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:29,040
Also, I would never think of...

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,330
I did not expect that one.

159
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,460
What the heck?

160
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:40,380
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, I think we ought to walk back and figure out what's up.

161
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:41,980
Hold on.

162
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:43,110
There's more.

163
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:44,960
Yo, yo, yo, we got it.

164
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:46,310
We ought to walk back.

165
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:47,630
All right.

166
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:50,850
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

167
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,850
Chat: "In the end is a walking simulator."

168
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,480
I know, right?

169
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:58,010
At one point it is.

170
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:03,780
It's everyone.

171
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:05,360
We are getting ending three.

172
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:07,630
Let's go.

173
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,500
Okay.

174
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:17,290
Oh.

175
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,610
It's her.

176
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,310
Woah!

177
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,430
Whoa, okay.

178
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,610
I forgot about that.

179
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:28,480
I legit do.

180
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:31,210
I legit forgot about it.

181
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:35,810
Okay.

182
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:36,030
Yep.

183
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:38,750
It's the chaos part.

184
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,950
Where everything goes wrong.

185
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,230
Then the landslide.

186
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,390
There's a note.

187
00:11:58,483 --> 00:11:59,700
Oh, my God.

188
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,390
Jesus Christus...

189
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,000
Woah! Already.

190
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:21,360
Okay.

191
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:24,250
I haven't walked.

192
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:29,130
I just noticed the guys clock has 10:10 on it.

193
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,160
Oh, it's the dude.

194
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,850
This is ending three.

195
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,110
What is it?

196
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:09,510
Wait.

197
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,230
Woah!

198
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,110
Okay.

199
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:52,390
I guess so.

200
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,680
There it is.

201
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,310
The third ending.

202
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,130
Do we have everything?

203
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:06,700
We're missing one note.

204
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:09,780
Where is that note?

205
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:14,280
What?

206
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:18,040
Yo, no, we can't…

207
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:21,310
We got all the visuals, but one note.

208
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:23,200
One note!

209
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,460
One freaking note!

210
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:26,680
Are you joking?

211
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:30,600
Where the hell am I missing that one note from?

212
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:33,080
Hold on.

213
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,030
It's been between…

214
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:39,100
Chat: "Did you get the one note from the pinning board around chapter 6 or 7?

215
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,130
It's like near the newspaper on the pinning board."

216
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:42,790
Wait, I didn't…

217
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:45,410
Wait, I didn't even notice!

218
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,100
Was there?

219
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,280
Around 6 or 7, right?

220
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:56,380
Let's head back.

221
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,210
That pinning board.

222
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,310
I don't see a note here.

223
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:19,530
There's no note on that one either.

224
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,304
And there's Pekora.

225
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:30,150
There's no note on here either.

226
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,330
Okay, we're well after that.

227
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:39,980
Don't see a note here.

228
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,680
There's one thing I have questions about.

229
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:48,340
What's the dude have to do with Aogami school?

230
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:52,780
Like, that dude is not us, right?

231
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,610
Even that.

232
00:17:58,616 --> 00:18:01,230
That dude comes up.

233
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,880
It's so wack.

234
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,310
Chat: "That creepy dude could be ehmm... our grandfather?"

235
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,010
Oh, maybe.

236
00:18:15,016 --> 00:18:17,950
Yeah, that could be.

237
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:19,610
Thinking about that.

238
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:22,137
That could be.

239
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:24,810
Because he could be dead.

240
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:30,280
he might have gotten the same curse.

241
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:31,980
The same…

242
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:34,660
The Aogami curse.

243
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,230
Woah, okay.

244
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,530
For a serious good second, I thought there was something.

245
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,510
It's that note!

246
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:45,090
That note that you're talking about!

247
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:51,610
"As part of the investigation, I was able to interview a resident about rumors surrounding the woods around us.

248
00:18:51,616 --> 00:18:53,000
The story starts about two generations ago.

249
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,230
Even back then, Aogami was plagued by landslides, natural disasters, and other misfortunes.

250
00:18:57,233 --> 00:19:02,810
In response, the residents at the time performed ritual human sacrifices in the woods near Aogami.

251
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:07,280
Even today, rumors profilerate about those woods.

252
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:11,680
With people saying they hear screaming in the night or see ghosts wandering in the area.

253
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:16,030
Might those human sacrifices be the root cause of all the paranormal happenings in this town?

254
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:19,950
Either way, I've decided to pay the woods a visit myself."

255
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:23,590
That could be the answer.

256
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,730
Let's check the inventory.

257
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:33,660
"Supernatural phenomenon #1"

258
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,810
It is!

259
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:35,560
Yup, it is!

260
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:36,750
We got them!

261
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,280
All of them!

262
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:41,130
Okay, let's try to complete them then.

263
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,760
Hmm.

264
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:51,180
These three endings really leave me still questioning.

265
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,610
Yup.

266
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:02,160
All papers obtained.

267
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:08,772
Chat: "Either way, it would be pretty worth it."

268
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:12,040
Yeah, actually, it is worth playing.

269
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,560
It is worth playing.

270
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:14,910
Because, look at that!

271
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,510
We just completed two days worth of Halloween.

272
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:20,230
Which is…

273
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:25,230
Technically Halloween in my time and then Halloween in the Western time.

274
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,249
Right.

275
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:30,900
So.

276
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,180
How is everyone?

277
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:34,630
How are y'all feeling?

278
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:37,410
What do you guys think?

279
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:42,210
Is Hololive Error something that you would find yourself enjoying?

280
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:44,290
I actually enjoy making the stream.

281
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:45,400
Like, legit.

282
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,160
I legit do enjoy making the stream.

283
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:55,260
It's not just Hololive Error in general, but just any kind of stream to be honest.

284
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:59,680
Yeah, I'm hoping to bring way more stuff to improvements.

285
00:20:59,683 --> 00:21:04,500
But if there's anything that I want to dedicate to the most, it would be to thumbnails.

286
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:11,410
I'm gonna be doubling down on my efforts on thumbnails to hopefully be able to promote my stream a lot better.

287
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:15,310
And for people to notice my stream a lot more.

288
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,810
But…

289
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:24,492
With that aside, I'm gonna see what I can do to significantly shorten the time

290
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:28,943
of my workflow while keeping the same level of quality.

291
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:32,060
But before that, here's a little surprise.

292
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:37,210
If you know Hololive enough, then you probably know this by now.

293
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:43,250
I kind of searched around where I was at and I found this.

294
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,480
I found Curry Meshi.

295
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:49,700
I found it.

296
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,250
The very thing that Hololive has been promoting for a while.

297
00:21:56,683 --> 00:22:03,960
I got extremely curious, so I bought it without knowing what I'm going to expect.

298
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:06,510
So I'm gonna have it for dinner tonight.

299
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:07,730
Like, hear this...

300
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,080
Are you hearing this?

301
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,880
This?

302
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:13,750
Yeah, I actually got it.

303
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,830
I'm gonna have this after the stream, so…

304
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,030
This could be a very good celebration for myself,

305
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:22,930
especially when it has something to do with Hololive for no reason.

306
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:24,840
Okay, okay.

307
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:30,080
Right, so how am I gonna be scheduling my streams from here on point?

308
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:33,330
I'm not gonna be doing big streams that often.

309
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,080
I'll be doing a couple of little streams here and there.

310
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:43,930
But this is enough to stall and give me enough time to make highlights of my own.

311
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:53,180
The important part is to be able to balance between making highlights for my highlights channel.

312
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:55,430
And yeah.

313
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:56,660
That's it.

314
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:02,650
I'm so glad to have pushed myself to pull shits like this off on stream.

315
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,650
Like, the little details on stream, like the effect, the VFX.

316
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:12,650
The acting on...

317
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:16,010
on section C.

318
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:18,000
I don't know, what do you call that section C?

319
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,748
The alternate scene C or something?

320
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:26,960
Part C is what some stream addresses as.

321
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:30,380
All that little detail, including the poster as well.

322
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:32,080
To be honest, I…

323
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,660
Right, I forgot to mention.

324
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:39,040
I would like to thank those 20 Twitter likes that I got for that part 1 poster.

325
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:46,380
That part 1 poster is currently the most liked post on all of my Twitter.

326
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,230
I…

327
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:51,660
Even though it's just 20, it's still…

328
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:58,530
In a matter of just a couple of days, hitting 20 likes is kind of monumental for me.

329
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:00,580
And…

330
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,840
I don't know what to say.

331
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:07,400
View count really isn't my focus.

332
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:12,650
What really matters is, did I enjoy the game?

333
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,530
To which I answer, yes!

334
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:17,060
Yes I hella do!

335
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:23,530
It just leaves me a little bit wondering at times.

336
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:25,980
Phew.

337
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,310

00:24:37,516 --> 00:24:40,330
Yup, Gank is a social media apparently.

341
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,710
On top of being a donation platform, it's also a social media.

342
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:44,790
Follow me on Gank as well.

343
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,000

00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:55,360
I'll catch you guys on Wednesday.

346
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:56,860
