1
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:05,316
Eyyy~

2
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:06,650
Hello, hello!

3
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:09,050
KonMelo, KonMelo, KonMelo!

4
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,733
Hello, hello, how y'all doing?

5
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:13,533
Happy Halloween in Japanese time, that is.

6
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:14,983
Y'all doing fine?

7
01:01:16,933 --> 01:01:18,666
Well, I'm not sure about myself though.

8
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:20,783
Because…

9
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,000
I'm gonna be turning the lights off.

10
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:27,083
So, it's going to be a
little bit crazy, so…

11
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:27,983
Ahem.

12
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:31,333
I have not streamed any horror games
before, but I wanna start somewhere.

13
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:36,199
If I were to describe how I'm
feeling, it's kind of a mixed feeling.

14
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:42,283
Because I bought this
game through donators.

15
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:49,283
Big shoutout to
PapayaUriah, Chi, and Koeil.

16
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:52,566
For donating to me on Ko-fi.

17
01:01:53,533 --> 01:01:55,816
Right, without further ado,
let's get right into the game.

18
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,083
Phew

19
01:01:58,083 --> 01:01:59,416
I'm getting so nervous right now.

20
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:04,733
Because it's like, I'm half expected and
half not expected, that kind of thing.

21
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,633
Here goes nothing.

22
01:02:08,866 --> 01:02:10,033
So, here we go.

23
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,333
Begin.

24
01:02:13,966 --> 01:02:14,666
So…

25
01:02:15,316 --> 01:02:16,866
We're the investigator.

26
01:02:18,816 --> 01:02:19,633
A recorder.

27
01:02:21,683 --> 01:02:22,583
Okay, cool.

28
01:02:24,033 --> 01:02:24,800
What do we have here?

29
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:31,933
So, I assume this investi- this
guy came over here for a trip.

30
01:02:33,033 --> 01:02:34,833
Excerpt from Grandfather's document.

31
01:02:35,016 --> 01:02:35,833
"Aogami today".

32
01:02:36,466 --> 01:02:40,516
"The repeated landslides, ghost
sightings, and reports of missing persons

33
01:02:40,516 --> 01:02:44,366
have led to a steady decline in
Aogami's population over the years.

34
01:02:45,066 --> 01:02:48,533
As residents refuse to
live in such a cursed town.

35
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:54,333
They say the town of Aogami has been beset
by landslides throughout its history.

36
01:02:55,883 --> 01:03:00,983
This could be due to excessive
deforestation or weak soil.

37
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,266
But the residents of old Aogami
believed

38
01:03:04,266 --> 01:03:06,683
that it was the anger of the mountain spirits."

39
01:03:12,533 --> 01:03:13,000
Who's that?

40
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,416
Yes, yes, yes, coming.

41
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,216
What the fuck?

42
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:27,483
What the shit?

43
01:03:27,983 --> 01:03:28,650
The door just…

44
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:36,883
Anyone back here?

45
01:03:37,233 --> 01:03:37,466
No?

46
01:03:39,699 --> 01:03:40,133
Okay.

47
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:42,833
Somebody's calling.

48
01:03:46,216 --> 01:03:46,566
FWURGH!

49
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:50,016
Oy, Jesus.

50
01:03:52,466 --> 01:03:53,849
Who is it?

51
01:03:55,716 --> 01:03:56,683
UWARGH!

52
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:58,916
Okay.

53
01:03:59,616 --> 01:04:00,449
Who was that?

54
01:04:02,683 --> 01:04:03,116
Okay.

55
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:04,716
Where is this?

56
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:06,900
It's a school.

57
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,266
"The Rumor of the Art Prep Room.

58
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:15,233
They say that a long time ago, a female
student who was obsessed with painting

59
01:04:15,233 --> 01:04:16,366
something no one else could…

60
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,333
used her own…

61
01:04:21,383 --> 01:04:22,216
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

62
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:23,933
The lights.

63
01:04:23,933 --> 01:04:24,666
The lights are flickering.

64
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:30,433
I don't understand one thing.

65
01:04:35,016 --> 01:04:43,683
What is with the amount of leftover
school bags and papers in Aogami High?

66
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:45,750
What's going on there?

67
01:04:48,816 --> 01:04:49,599
Whoa.

68
01:04:50,733 --> 01:04:51,599
That little jitter.

69
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:54,849
That little jitter really
had me for a second...

70
01:04:56,483 --> 01:04:57,699
More leftover bags.

71
01:04:58,066 --> 01:04:58,516
What's going on?

72
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:05,166
Okay,

73
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,000
this is dark.

74
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:12,533
What happened here?

75
01:05:20,966 --> 01:05:23,116
Uh, excuse me, miss?

76
01:05:25,099 --> 01:05:26,866
What are you doing in
the middle of the night?

77
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:28,599
At school...?

78
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:41,566
Doko [Where]?

79
01:05:41,566 --> 01:05:42,566
Doko [Where]?

80
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:43,599
Where you at?

81
01:05:47,266 --> 01:05:48,650
I hear dialogues.

82
01:06:02,616 --> 01:06:05,599
What do you mean by "you
won't know until you hear it"?

83
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:10,883
Whoa!

84
01:06:12,766 --> 01:06:13,766
It opened itself.

85
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:18,633
What's this?

86
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,316
That's them!

87
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:35,166
WURGHH!

88
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,599
Okay.

89
01:06:42,816 --> 01:06:43,599
Okay, what the fuck?

90
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:48,949
Dare [Who]?

91
01:06:51,316 --> 01:06:52,199
Okay...

92
01:07:10,166 --> 01:07:11,716
Holy fuck.

93
01:07:13,949 --> 01:07:15,250
Okay, that-

94
01:07:21,016 --> 01:07:22,650
Uh, 'scuse me?

95
01:07:23,566 --> 01:07:28,599
Uh, who could you be?

96
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:32,433
Okay.

97
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,633
Okay!

98
01:07:44,366 --> 01:07:45,166
Whoa.

99
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:55,833
What?

100
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,966
Wait, wha-?

101
01:08:04,183 --> 01:08:05,366
What happened here?

102
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,050
Why-

103
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,983
Why are we caved in?

104
01:08:19,216 --> 01:08:20,850
It happened again!

105
01:08:27,016 --> 01:08:27,949
Jesus...

106
01:08:29,633 --> 01:08:33,083
Oh no, things are turning
a little sideways now.

107
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,300
Oh.

108
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:42,666
More and more of the
building is going down.

109
01:08:44,649 --> 01:08:46,116
Oh no...

110
01:08:46,949 --> 01:08:48,216
UWARH!

111
01:08:49,566 --> 01:08:50,800
Okay!

112
01:08:51,733 --> 01:08:52,616
What...

113
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,250
What...?

114
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:56,066
What- What was that?

115
01:08:56,066 --> 01:08:57,250
What was that???

116
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:01,733
Oy

117
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:08,399
Even more of the back is gone!

118
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:15,616
Are we able to open this door?

119
01:09:24,449 --> 01:09:26,933
Uhhh.

120
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,416
Uhhh.

121
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:32,766
Uhhh...

122
01:09:33,183 --> 01:09:34,033
Okay...

123
01:09:34,283 --> 01:09:36,449
I suppose we're supposed to approach her.

124
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:39,866
Uh, miss?

125
01:09:42,066 --> 01:09:43,350
Uhhh.

126
01:09:43,766 --> 01:09:45,016
UWARRGGGHH!!!!

127
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:46,816
Okay.

128
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,066
Wait.

129
01:10:22,683 --> 01:10:24,100
What are we expecting?

130
01:10:25,183 --> 01:10:26,333
No one?

131
01:10:27,433 --> 01:10:27,866
Who

132
01:10:28,066 --> 01:10:29,649
the fuck-

133
01:10:49,866 --> 01:10:50,850
Don't tell me

134
01:10:51,316 --> 01:10:52,483
She's there...

135
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:55,016
Wait, what???

136
01:11:00,366 --> 01:11:02,716
We're not home anymore.

137
01:11:05,366 --> 01:11:07,399
Where do you think this is?

138
01:11:10,149 --> 01:11:11,633
It's a school.

139
01:11:13,966 --> 01:11:15,949
Bags, briefcases...

140
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:25,183
I just realized that there's a
picture of a shrine in every room.

141
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:28,633
What is going on?

142
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:41,033
Scattered chairs and tables...

143
01:11:48,016 --> 01:11:48,766
Okay.

144
01:11:50,216 --> 01:11:50,983
Alright.

145
01:11:51,866 --> 01:11:52,683
It's just a game.

146
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:53,783
It's just a game, Mel.

147
01:11:53,783 --> 01:11:54,750
It's just a game.

148
01:11:58,866 --> 01:12:00,133
Someone's crying...

149
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:10,533
Oh no, there's no lights.

150
01:12:10,533 --> 01:12:13,133
There's no lights to this one.

151
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,850
You!

152
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:33,550
It's you again!

153
01:12:35,366 --> 01:12:37,199
What are you doing here?

154
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,699
Why are you here?

155
01:12:39,699 --> 01:12:43,516
What are you in here for?

156
01:12:43,516 --> 01:12:46,333
What's your purpose???

157
01:12:48,233 --> 01:12:50,033
Why?

158
01:12:56,683 --> 01:12:58,333
Blood...

159
01:13:02,816 --> 01:13:05,033
It's the paint tool.

160
01:13:08,199 --> 01:13:09,183
'Kay.

161
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:11,133
UWERGH!

162
01:13:13,266 --> 01:13:14,449
That-

163
01:13:14,449 --> 01:13:15,783
Whoa.

164
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:22,533
What's this, a massacre?

165
01:13:30,716 --> 01:13:33,266
What is going on here?

166
01:13:42,016 --> 01:13:43,500
Okay.

167
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,133
It sounds like she ran away.

168
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:53,833
Why is this door left open?

169
01:13:54,616 --> 01:13:54,916
What?

170
01:13:54,916 --> 01:13:55,883
Wh-

171
01:13:57,983 --> 01:13:59,433
Who was it?

172
01:13:59,433 --> 01:14:01,199
What is it?

173
01:14:02,416 --> 01:14:04,016
I heard steps.

174
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:06,533
It's-

175
01:14:07,383 --> 01:14:08,583
complete darkness.

176
01:14:09,416 --> 01:14:10,866
We're at a shrine.

177
01:14:12,133 --> 01:14:13,500
And her again.

178
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,116
That girl.

179
01:14:15,116 --> 01:14:16,899
That girl from earlier.

180
01:14:19,699 --> 01:14:21,600
Is this the same girl?

181
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,333
Doesn't look like it though.

182
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,399
Hm?

183
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:47,916
What...

184
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:50,433
really happened?

185
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:56,166
Now that I think about it.

186
01:14:57,433 --> 01:14:58,100
Wait!

187
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:59,399
I see a leg!

188
01:15:00,283 --> 01:15:01,883
Something's not right.

189
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:04,133
Did you see that?

190
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:05,833
There was a leg over there!

191
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:07,333
Like, in the corner!

192
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:08,250
Like-

193
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,350
Somebody-

194
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:11,166
Somebody was here!

195
01:15:11,166 --> 01:15:12,666
Somebody was here!

196
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:21,083
Why did my bathroom open?

197
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:27,399
Wha-?

198
01:15:34,716 --> 01:15:36,133
It's them again.

199
01:15:40,983 --> 01:15:41,933
What...

200
01:15:41,933 --> 01:15:43,516
the hell?

201
01:15:46,533 --> 01:15:47,466
Wait!

202
01:15:47,466 --> 01:15:48,083
Wait!

203
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:48,666
Wait!

204
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:49,416
That girl!

205
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:50,566
That girl in the background!

206
01:15:50,566 --> 01:15:52,050
She disappeared!

207
01:15:54,949 --> 01:15:57,183
Where's this coming from?

208
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:16,149
What did I do?

209
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:22,433
Who is it this time?

210
01:16:22,433 --> 01:16:22,699
Wait.

211
01:16:22,699 --> 01:16:23,616
Wha-?

212
01:16:27,399 --> 01:16:29,166
We're in a train now...

213
01:16:32,033 --> 01:16:33,149
Okay.

214
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:37,050
A very normal…

215
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:39,833
train.

216
01:16:40,433 --> 01:16:42,166
I suppose?

217
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:47,449
What?

218
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:52,083
What's going on over there?

219
01:16:52,766 --> 01:16:54,916
Why is there some hitting sounds going on?

220
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,500
What's sparking there?

221
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:01,300
What?

222
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,383
UWARGHHH!!!

223
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,566
Oh my God...

224
01:17:11,283 --> 01:17:12,216
I was-

225
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:14,533
I was not expecting anyone, really...

226
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:19,416
"I see you don't do well
with horror after that?"

227
01:17:20,733 --> 01:17:22,550
I- I- I guess so.

228
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:24,283
I guess you can put it that way.

229
01:17:24,283 --> 01:17:25,149
But…

230
01:17:25,149 --> 01:17:28,733
It's kinda the-

231
01:17:28,733 --> 01:17:34,183
There's kinda a reason why I-

232
01:17:34,183 --> 01:17:37,683
I- I- I hesitated when I-

233
01:17:37,683 --> 01:17:40,266
When I hesitated when-

234
01:17:40,266 --> 01:17:41,883
When being suggested a horror game.

235
01:17:41,883 --> 01:17:45,583
So this game kinda is
going to prove my point.

236
01:17:46,149 --> 01:17:47,500
Oh, we're supposed to follow her!

237
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,383
Okay, we're supposed to follow the...

238
01:17:50,683 --> 01:17:52,216
"MelLUL A little girl pushes you down."

239
01:17:52,216 --> 01:17:52,566
Oi!

240
01:17:52,566 --> 01:17:56,833
Oi oi oi oi oi!

241
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:59,600
Careful with your wording, alright?

242
01:18:03,766 --> 01:18:05,266
Th' train's stopping.

243
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:09,316
Light's goes out.

244
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:16,566
It's her again!

245
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:17,250
That-

246
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,283
That girl from the beginning.

247
01:18:19,283 --> 01:18:20,383
No, not the beginning.

248
01:18:20,383 --> 01:18:22,216
Th- Th- The second girl.

249
01:18:22,216 --> 01:18:23,750
That we see in the game.

250
01:18:30,833 --> 01:18:31,866
She's gone.

251
01:18:45,966 --> 01:18:46,916
Uhhh.

252
01:18:47,683 --> 01:18:49,050
She's slamming the window...

253
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:51,033
Could she be-

254
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:53,233
Yuka?

255
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:55,366
Uhhh.

256
01:18:55,366 --> 01:18:57,616
Ano [umm]...UGHH!

257
01:19:00,183 --> 01:19:01,633
Okay.

258
01:19:01,633 --> 01:19:04,033
Alright.

259
01:19:04,033 --> 01:19:05,199
I-

260
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:08,050
I guess it could be vital to the story.

261
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:10,066
I guess.

262
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:14,750
There's-

263
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,566
There's two more person here.

264
01:19:18,066 --> 01:19:18,433
Uh.

265
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:20,500
Ano [umm]...

266
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,233
Su-

267
01:19:21,233 --> 01:19:23,566
Sumimasen [Excuse me].

268
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:31,816
The slamming stopped.

269
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,583
We're back in…

270
01:19:40,483 --> 01:19:41,899
Aogami High School.

271
01:19:42,383 --> 01:19:44,333
Again.

272
01:19:49,866 --> 01:19:51,949
A couple of girls.

273
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:00,716
Okay.

274
01:20:05,983 --> 01:20:07,550
There's another person.

275
01:20:11,633 --> 01:20:12,483
Uwah!

276
01:20:14,616 --> 01:20:15,183
Ow, my eyes.

277
01:20:15,183 --> 01:20:15,866
That was-

278
01:20:15,866 --> 01:20:17,433
That flashbang though.

279
01:20:22,216 --> 01:20:23,216
Wait.

280
01:20:23,216 --> 01:20:24,966
Another girl missing.

281
01:20:24,966 --> 01:20:26,300
From that picture earlier.

282
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,750
That we saw earlier.

283
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:29,183
That picture.

284
01:20:30,233 --> 01:20:31,733
Also, where's my flashlight?

285
01:20:31,733 --> 01:20:34,000
What happened to my flashlight?

286
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,016
My flashlight's gone.

287
01:20:42,516 --> 01:20:44,149
Oh no.

288
01:20:46,683 --> 01:20:49,283
Oh no, it's getting darker in here now.

289
01:20:49,283 --> 01:20:52,133
We're supposed to use the
camera flash, I suppose,

290
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:54,066
To find out where-

291
01:20:55,466 --> 01:20:57,833
What we're supposed to look at.

292
01:21:04,316 --> 01:21:05,766
It's you again!

293
01:21:06,716 --> 01:21:07,699
Uh!

294
01:21:07,699 --> 01:21:08,899
Yuka-san?

295
01:21:15,616 --> 01:21:16,883
What???

296
01:21:20,416 --> 01:21:22,516
We're in the trains again.

297
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:25,300
How much film do we have?

298
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,466
What the heck?

299
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:29,333
How many rolls of film do we have?

300
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:31,750
Just- Just to pull off
this amount of flash.

301
01:21:33,766 --> 01:21:34,533
Woah-

302
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:40,600
Who-

303
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:43,116
Who in the world was that?!

304
01:21:43,116 --> 01:21:44,899
Who in the world was that?!

305
01:21:51,066 --> 01:21:52,316
Who are you?!

306
01:21:52,316 --> 01:21:53,699
Tell me!

307
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:58,783
What business do you have here?!

308
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:03,916
It's almost like this
guy is going through-

309
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:06,366
Five stages of grief.

310
01:22:14,216 --> 01:22:16,583
UWARGHHH!!!

311
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:19,183
Who the fuck are you?!

312
01:22:22,533 --> 01:22:23,850
Flashlight.

313
01:22:26,683 --> 01:22:27,500
UWARGHHH!!!

314
01:22:29,649 --> 01:22:30,399
Who-

315
01:22:31,383 --> 01:22:32,350
Wait...

316
01:22:33,766 --> 01:22:35,233
The camera's gone!

317
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:40,250
We're back to our flashlights.

318
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:51,383
Yuka?

319
01:22:55,566 --> 01:22:57,350
She's getting closer!

320
01:23:01,016 --> 01:23:02,750
And closer!

321
01:23:09,433 --> 01:23:10,633
Yu-...

322
01:23:10,633 --> 01:23:11,616
Yu-...

323
01:23:11,616 --> 01:23:12,850
UWERH!!!

324
01:23:15,516 --> 01:23:16,433
What?!

325
01:23:19,733 --> 01:23:20,750
Wait!

326
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:22,199
What's going on?

327
01:23:23,816 --> 01:23:25,083
You?

328
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,733
Her?

329
01:23:29,449 --> 01:23:31,933
Hueh?

330
01:23:39,783 --> 01:23:42,199
It's repeating itself!

331
01:23:47,883 --> 01:23:48,899
Wha-

332
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:50,800
Hueh?

333
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,633
Nani (what)?

334
01:23:52,583 --> 01:23:54,533
What's going on???

335
01:24:07,283 --> 01:24:08,616
UWARGHHH!!!

336
01:24:17,866 --> 01:24:22,250
What the fuck?!

337
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:27,899
Who's that dude?!

338
01:24:29,083 --> 01:24:30,033
Who's that dude?!

339
01:24:35,483 --> 01:24:39,166
Wha-

340
01:24:40,666 --> 01:24:43,866
We're at the shrine again.

341
01:24:47,699 --> 01:24:48,866
Who-

342
01:24:49,883 --> 01:24:51,899
Who's that?

343
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:00,583
Who are you?!

344
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:07,233
UWERGHHH!!!

345
01:25:07,233 --> 01:25:10,016
Oh, Namo Amitabha!

346
01:25:29,766 --> 01:25:31,266
Hm?

347
01:25:39,733 --> 01:25:40,699
Eh?

348
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,449
Ending 1, 404 not found.

349
01:25:45,449 --> 01:25:48,466
Wait, there's multiple
endings to this game?

350
01:25:49,633 --> 01:25:49,983
Archives.

351
01:25:54,183 --> 01:25:56,166
There's more to this.

352
01:25:58,533 --> 01:25:59,383
She's the-

353
01:25:59,383 --> 01:26:01,500
She's the painter girl!

354
01:26:02,316 --> 01:26:03,683
Whuoa!

355
01:26:03,683 --> 01:26:05,483
What the fuck is this visual?

356
01:26:05,483 --> 01:26:06,716
Holy crap.

357
01:26:09,516 --> 01:26:11,533
So there's more to this, hold on.

358
01:26:13,033 --> 01:26:15,550
So that's the first ending.

359
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:20,500
So will we actually-

360
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,083
Will we actually find a different ending?

361
01:26:23,083 --> 01:26:25,966
If we actually start the
game again right now.

362
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:29,966
Are we expected to have a-

363
01:26:29,966 --> 01:26:31,250
A different-

364
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:32,483
UERGH!

365
01:26:32,483 --> 01:26:33,416
Okay, it's that-

366
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:33,733
It's that-

367
01:26:33,733 --> 01:26:34,633
It's that scene earlier.

368
01:26:37,783 --> 01:26:40,166
Maybe we are on the wrong chapter...

369
01:26:42,516 --> 01:26:44,300
Presumably...

370
01:26:45,716 --> 01:26:48,766
Had we not done certain things

371
01:26:48,766 --> 01:26:50,716
that we're supposed to do,

372
01:26:51,366 --> 01:26:53,683
will it take us to a different end?

373
01:26:56,633 --> 01:27:00,066
"You will keep unlocked
archives and chapters."

374
01:27:00,066 --> 01:27:02,083
"Delete current inventory?"

375
01:27:03,733 --> 01:27:04,899
Okay.

376
01:27:05,516 --> 01:27:07,816
Let's try running the whole game

377
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:11,633
with the knowledge of the inventory.

378
01:27:11,633 --> 01:27:13,416
Wait- Oh my god, I went
to press "Continue",

379
01:27:13,416 --> 01:27:16,116
I'm supposed to press
"Chapters" or something.

380
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:18,500
Oh wait, wait, wait.

381
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,100
Since we're in game,

382
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:22,683
maybe we can see our
inventories from here.

383
01:27:23,766 --> 01:27:26,916
What was in our inventory the whole time?

384
01:27:30,016 --> 01:27:32,699
Oh, so that's-

385
01:27:32,699 --> 01:27:36,583
So the notes are the inventory.

386
01:27:39,266 --> 01:27:41,899

01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,733
Still getting me confused right now.

388
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:49,516
What part are we missing?

389
01:27:53,733 --> 01:27:55,116
'right.
