1
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:01,333
I'll press play first.

2
00:00:01,683 --> 00:00:02,116
What?!

3
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:04,866
They have a launcher and it says signing in.

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,066
What?

5
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:09,150
Okay, okay, uh, volume mixer.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,383
Trust me bro, you won't die.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,866
I don't think so amigo.

8
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:20,016
Woo, poor Scott, we're leaving him hanging right now.

9
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:42,166
Kon-Melo~

10
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:48,783
So good to be back again

11
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:55,666
It's been so long since I last gone live on on anywhere ever

12
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:56,883
Okay.

13
00:00:57,466 --> 00:00:59,016
Ah, I'm getting so excited.

14
00:00:59,033 --> 00:00:59,833
Here's the thing, right?

15
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:00,566
Here's the deal.

16
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:01,683
Okay, um

17
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:06,883
The thumbnail and the game category says Forza Horizon 5, 'kay?

18
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:10,166
I literally bought this game literal hours before the stream

19
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,299
Okay

20
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:15,250
so,

21
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:17,883
I have not touched the game ever

22
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:23,033
like this is going to be my absolute first touch on the game

23
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:25,883
So hopefully hopefully this goes well

24
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:27,566
Press play first.

25
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:28,400
What?!

26
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:31,333
They have a launcher and it says signing in.

27
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,366
What?

28
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,516
That is insane

29
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:35,950
Syncing data.

30
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:36,400
Oh, wat.

31
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:38,683
It's doing pre-syncing beforehand.

32
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,166
What kind of launcher is this?

33
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,216
I've never seen this before.

34
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:41,666
What the hell?

35
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,116
"Gaming Services UI"

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,933
Oh, it's Xbox's own in-house launcher for Forza

37
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:51,033
Now I'm just trying to start the game.

38
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:52,783
It's gonna take a little while

39
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,883
My PC is slow

40
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:01,116
It's so slow I can see my I can see the SSD going already.

41
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:03,566
It's like it's working its asses off right now

42
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,916
Chat: "Anyways bets on how long it is before she crashes."

43
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,816
No, no.

44
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:10,616
No, no, no, I don't want no crashes today

45
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:13,316
I don't wish for any crashes today

46
00:02:16,983 --> 00:02:18,716
I don't wish for any crashes ever.

47
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,300
Oh, oh, oh, it's accessing more files on the disk.

48
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,500
Okay, it's touching my SSD again

49
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,483
Oh, it's going up again.

50
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:25,699
Oh, oh, yes.

51
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:26,533
Oh, here we go.

52
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:27,766
Oh, it's gonna get loud.

53
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:29,616
Oh, where's the volume mixer?

54
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:30,449
Where's the volume mixer?

55
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:31,050
Hold on.

56
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:31,383
Hold on.

57
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:32,500
Where is the volume mixer?

58
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,750
Where's the windows key?

59
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:35,250
Where is it?

60
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:35,599
Where is it?

61
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:36,633
Okay.

62
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:37,099
Okay

63
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:41,300
Disclaimer okay, uh, volume mixer?

64
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,133
Okay,

65
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,433
it's not so loud it's not so loud it's not so loud,

66
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,366
okay, I think I think we can I think we can do

67
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:49,949
This I think I think it's I think it's alright

68
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,449
Okay, okay, okay.

69
00:02:53,683 --> 00:02:54,033
Okay.

70
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:54,433
Okay.

71
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:55,816
It's not too bad.

72
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:56,483
It's not too bad

73
00:02:57,983 --> 00:02:58,916
It's not too bad.

74
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,683
I don't I think...

75
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,233
I don't think I have to pull it down

76
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,250
Oh, nevermind.

77
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,133
It's not showing at all

78
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,316
OBS could capture it but not but before there is it

79
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,199
for whatever reason it's not showing.

80
00:03:12,383 --> 00:03:13,033
I don't know what's up.

81
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:14,933
Oh, there's my reason

82
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,583
I forgot to turn it on

83
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:29,699
Let's get the volume fix first cuz

84
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,716
Why do we have to save first? Why can't we just adjust it as we go?

85
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,883
Oh my, the motion blur you see that? The motion blur on the scrolling,

86
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:46,016
Holy

87
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,583
That is... oh my, okay.

88
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:50,233
I love that.

89
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:50,616
Okay.

90
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,383
I love that

91
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,116
controls...

92
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:54,633
change input mapping...

93
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:01,133
Oh, no, does it not have a playstation

94
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:03,616
No

95
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,316
But wait, it captures though.

96
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,466
My mouse disappeared when I moved the controller

97
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:13,849
Microsoft, that's a missed opportunity!

98
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:18,449
Oh my god, hold on where is my Xbox controller?

99
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:19,983
I'm gonna go grab them right now

100
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,399
They have the guts to bring the game to steam

101
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,750
but not have the guts to bring PlayStation controls into here

102
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,866
You kidding me

103
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:31,116
That aside.

104
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,533
!-
I got my Xbox controller.

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,016
Now, I just gotta plug it in

106
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,649
'right.

107
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,916
Let's get the cable.

108
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:38,033
ERH!

109
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:45,133
Let's plug it in port number one and the controller...

110
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:46,233
Wee~

111
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:51,350
Oh? There's the window sound the satisfying usual window sound.

112
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,500
Hey, it works.

113
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,949
Let's go.

114
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,100
Works by default

115
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:56,516
Difficulty

116
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:03,300
Mmm, how about I have it off?

117
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:10,666
Yeah, we'll have that. Let's go hard...

118
00:05:10,683 --> 00:05:13,166
on the driving part except for shifting.

119
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:13,850
I can't shift.

120
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:17,899
Driving line, we'll turn off driving line

121
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,166
because we all know that driving line is cringe

122
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,000
Launch control.

123
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:26,616
Ooh, okay.

124
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:31,466
Hold e-brake and throttle when stationary until the it stops increasing

125
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:32,966
then release it to launch

126
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:41,216
I know what launch control is, but why is there a toggle for that?

127
00:05:42,616 --> 00:05:44,800
Isn't that per the car basis or something?

128
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,183
Oh,well.

129
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:50,133
There is one thing I have to take care of though,

130
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,533
and that would be copyrights

131
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,833
Streamer mode.

132
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,966
No HDR display.

133
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:58,366
Okay

134
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,516
60 frames v-sync

135
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:02,850
Yeah, sure.

136
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,066
I'll have v-sync drive for driving games, v-sync is not too important

137
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:08,250
But if you're playing FPS, then yes, it would be important.

138
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,566
Motion blur, fuck you...

139
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:12,949
Okay

140
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:17,816
Graphics, yeah, let's turn up way down, but we'll have minimum of everything.

141
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:18,766
So like this

142
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,083
We'll have the minimum of everything

143
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:26,716
Well a little of everything, you know what?

144
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:27,600
No, no, no, no, no. No.

145
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,566
I got a different idea

146
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:30,333
Let's kick it.

147
00:06:30,383 --> 00:06:32,833
Let's kick it up the notch, max out the graphics

148
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,733
and then we'll go down from here on

149
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:36,383
We'll figure out how things goes

150
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,883
Raytracing, let's go

151
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:41,083
They have ray tracing!

152
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:42,233
Right, let's start.

153
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:43,766
Let's see how the frame rate goes.

154
00:06:46,983 --> 00:06:47,750
Oh, here comes

155
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:51,466
Oh, my frame rates

156
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:57,533
The problem with me using the Xbox controllers is listen to this

157
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,033
It's sticky.

158
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:02,433
I need to dismantle this controller one day and actually fix it.

159
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,316
Oh, here begins

160
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:10,216
Oh my god, that was so loud.

161
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,699
Holy that is loud

162
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,399
Ramiro: Home

163
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:19,566
Ramiro: The most beautiful place on Earth.

164
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:24,366
Ramiro: Where everyone is welcome.

165
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:24,983
Ooh.

166
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:32,483
Ramiro: Together, we can explore the wonder and beauty of Mexico.

167
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:33,100
Ooh.

168
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,449
Ramiro: Experience true freedom.

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,399
Ramiro: Feel alive.

170
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,100
Oooh, family.

171
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,316
Vin Diesels: Family, family, family...

172
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:51,416
Ramiro: Let's go together as friends...

173
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,050
Ramiro: ... and family.

174
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,383
FAMILY!!! Ay, let's gooooo!

175
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,500
Ramiro: You may ask, are we ready for what happens next?

176
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,550
This feels like Vin Diesel for some reason

177
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,716
Ramiro: My friend, one thing I have learned chasing the horizon...

178
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:11,566
Ramiro: Sometimes... you just have to let go and enjoy the ride.

179
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,600
Oh, here it begins.

180
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:19,633
Oh hold up, my frame rate is 44 right now.

181
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,283
Ok, I know how much it is now.

182
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,466
A to jump into the horizon.

183
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:28,833
Can I please press the pause button to turn the graphics down?

184
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,933
I want the maximum experience

185
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:32,516
God dang it.

186
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:35,616
Oh

187
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,683
Actually, it's not so bad.

188
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:42,566
41 frames while visually painful it's not so bad.

189
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,200
Oooh, drop it while it's hot.

190
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:47,833
Let's go

191
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,716
But please let me at least press the start button.

192
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:54,416
Let me go and turn down the graphics real quick.

193
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:56,600
AHHH, the framerates!

194
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:58,383
Ah, finally, okay.

195
00:08:58,633 --> 00:08:59,333
Okay settings.

196
00:08:59,333 --> 00:08:59,816
Where you at?

197
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:00,983
Um here

198
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:03,183
Okay, let's turn it down now

199
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:06,983
Video, no not here, graphics.

200
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:07,616
Yes.

201
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:09,866
Let's turn it to just Ultra

202
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:12,766
No, um restart later.

203
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:14,500
See how much can we improve from here?

204
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:20,350
Okay, most of the settings does not apply right now so we have to restart for real

205
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,433
While we're at it, let's have a good look at the some of the settings.

206
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:31,466
This is without way twa-

207
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:33,733
what the fuck am I saying, ray tracing!

208
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,066
We turn it to ultra and we restart right now.

209
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:38,866
Hopefully it starts fast enough though.

210
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:39,750
God damn it.

211
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,916
It's taking quite a while

212
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:44,283
I'm gonna go gremlin mode at this rate.

213
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:49,833
Ah that's so loud, why is there no skip button for this?

214
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:52,016
Microsoft why?

215
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,783
We're back in the video again, aren't we?

216
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,333
Can I skip this this time?

217
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,133
Can I skip it?

218
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:03,533
Like for real?

219
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:04,200
Can I skip it?

220
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,283
I want to skip it, please.

221
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:11,066
I've watched it once and I don't want to watch it twice, k.

222
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:13,566
God damn it

223
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,983
Okay lesson learned,

224
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,350

225
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,799

00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,883
RTGame is going to crash his car on his start.

235
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:09,766

00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,233
Okay, but there's more to come huh?

Let's go

305
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:03,933
I don't think so.

306
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,066
But vamos indeed

307
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:13,066
It doesn't allow me to off-road with this car

308
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:16,466
What? Did Mercedes not like it or something?

309
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,366
Did Mercedes not like me driving in an off-road or something? Come on

321
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,183

Xbox achievements

323
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:26,583

324
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:31,133
Oh, we're straight into the menu already Wow, okay.

325
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:32,116
Sure.

326
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:33,200
All right

327
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,233
Hold on what is this haircut?

328
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:37,533

No, not the haircut the hair color like.

Oh wait, there's a hair and hair color section.

332
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:49,766
So maybe I'll just pick the person itself and then I'll go from there

333
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:52,783
I'll take this and then hair color.

334
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:53,549
Oh, yeah.

00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:54,983
Okay, so it lets you do that

Chat: "You're gonna have blue hair and pronouns in this game."

337
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,016
I'll take this one. Hair color.

00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,933

Prosthetics

342
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:30,266
Oh that calls for inclusiv-

343
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,299
Inclusivity.

344
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:35,066
Okay, that's interesting, but I'm good for now

345
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:40,466

347
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,466
They have pronouns

348
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:46,466
Scott: Kinda left me hanging there, y'know.

349
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,233
Scott: Scotty had his... his intro all timed out.

350
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:50,233
Scott: But it's cool, it's cool.

351
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:54,983
Poor Scott, we're living him hanging right now.
