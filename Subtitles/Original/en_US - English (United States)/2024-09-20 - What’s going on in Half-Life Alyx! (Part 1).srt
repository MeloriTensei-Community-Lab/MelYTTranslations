1
00:00:00,183 --> 00:00:02,533
Hey, Kon-Melo, Kon-Melo, Kon-Melo.

2
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:05,533
It's ya Tech Wizardess girl, MeloriTensei!

3
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,516
Melori Valentine desu~!

4
00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:09,066
Right, let's go through some stuff

5
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:12,533
because here's an important note for people

6
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:15,616
who have been in the Half-Life,

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,266
as in Half-Life, like, universe as a whole.

8
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:23,116
The keyword is: I have not touched anything about Half-Life,

9
00:00:23,116 --> 00:00:26,316
so Half-Life Alyx became my introductory instead.

10
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:32,166
So I may not know about anything about the Half-Life lore altogether,

11
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:35,783
so hopefully you guys would be patient with me.

12
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:38,266
So we're at Half-Life Alyx now

13
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:43,116
and I have never really, really played Half-Life Alyx before

14
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:45,883
and I don't know anything about Half-Life as a whole.

15
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:48,183
I only know that Half-Life is just...

16
00:00:48,183 --> 00:00:50,133
it was an engine to me,
(Meme: STOP FUCKING WITH THE MICROWAVE!)

17
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,233
but I didn't know about the whole main game lore.

18
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:57,600
I know the existence of Gordon Freeman at least,

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,666
I hope that's bearable with some people,

20
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,616
but with that said, let's just get straight to it.

21
00:01:02,616 --> 00:01:03,566
Let's start.

22
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:04,583
Movement - blink.

23
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,866
No, I like Continuous Movement.

24
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,683
Weapon hand - I'll have it on the right hand for now

25
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:12,566
because even though I'm left-handed,

26
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:15,116
there's plenty of stuff that I do with my left (*right) hand.

27
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,700
Let's try playing at normal difficulty.

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,216
Let's see how hard can it be.

29
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:22,700
I mean, just like Clarkson says, "how hard can it be?".

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,883
So let's get straight to it.

31
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:26,900
This is my completely raw experience,

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,966
so I don't know what to expect at all.

33
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:34,483
Like this is going to be the rawest of raw experience to me.

34
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:38,483
Oh my god, the loading times are quite long, don't you think?

35
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:40,416
Ooo, okay, here we go.

36
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,866
It is five years before the collapse of the Citadel

37
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:46,383
and the end of Eli Vance.

38
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:48,366
Subject: Alyx Vance.

39
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:49,950
Age 19, female.

40
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,933
Affiliation: Human resistance

41
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:55,533
Current Assignment: Reconnaissance

42
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,666
How do I move in this?

43
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,083
Or am I not supposed to?

44
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:03,650
Presumably I'm not supposed to, yet.

45
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:06,283
"Push to move."

46
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,533
Oh, oh, oh, we're finally told to move.

47
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:11,183
Let's go.

48
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:12,833
Can I not..?

49
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,916
Can I touchy?

50
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,916
Let me try touchy.

51
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,666
Can I tap that?

52
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,683
Can I...?

53
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,750
Oh?

54
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:36,333
Anything here?

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,216
Nada.

56
00:02:38,216 --> 00:02:39,333
That's fucking useless.

57
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,316
Yeet!

58
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:46,016
Wait, can I open this? Hold on.

59
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:51,016
Oh, oh, fuck.

60
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:56,533
Wait, what's, what's my thumb doing?

61
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,183
My thumb's doing something funny.

62
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:00,033
My thumb is doing the funny.

63
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,083
Look at that.

64
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,766
My thumb's doing the funny.

65
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:15,750
I wonder what happens if I chuck it at some flyby airplanes or something.

66
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,733
Oh, a pigeon.

67
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:28,183
God damn it.

68
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,233
Felt eraser.

69
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,783
Multi-purpose.

70
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:34,583
Wait...

71
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,616
Oh, this is the drawing board itself.

72
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:59,366
Oh, it actually erases.

73
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:02,166
Oh, hey, a mug.

74
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,183
What's inside?

75
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,783
Nothing?

76
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:07,733
Ah, what a morning.

77
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:11,033
What a morning in the United Kingdom.

78
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:15,866
(Imitating slicing noises)

79
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:16,933
Let's receive a call.

80
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:19,133
Whoever this is.

81
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,116
Eli: Alyx! How's it looking up there?

82
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:23,000
Eli: What is it, Russell?

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,633
Alyx: What'd you?

84
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,683
Alyx: Terrific.

85
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:30,800
Okay, wait, can we call him back?

86
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,083
No?

87
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:37,683
Attention, citizens, you are about to be completely dictated

88
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:41,366
and ruled by yours truly.

89
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:47,933
(Grunting)

90
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,883
Oh, that was heavy.

91
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,416
Plug.

92
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,866
Plug.

93
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,433
Plug.

94
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,116
Oh, trophy.

95
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:02,116
Touchy, touchy.

96
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:04,316
Light switches.

97
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:13,583
Woah, блядь (fuck)!

98
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,283
Woah, what the fuck?

99
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,433
Oy, what the fuck, who dat?

100
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:25,133
Dang, I should have threw that bucket at him.

101
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:27,333
Здравствуйте (Hello)?

102
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,833
Uwah! Блядь (fuck)!

103
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:32,883
Okay, hello.

104
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,750
So are we supposed to...

105
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,366
"not coffee".

106
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:42,050
Oh, it's the feed for the bug.

107
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,316
Here you go.

108
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:45,300
(Steam notification)

109
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:47,683
I got an achievement to feed the pet.

110
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,583
So how much am I supposed to feed?

111
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,750
Oh, can I carry him?

112
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,183
No, I can't. Okay.

113
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:00,416
It's time to do some cleaning.

114
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:04,533
What if we go to other floors?

115
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:06,800
It won't work there.

116
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,433
Won't work here...

117
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,016
It won't work here.

118
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:11,933
Unknown person: Alyx.

119
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,383
Bonjour (Hello)?

120
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:17,250
Unknown person: Alyx.

121
00:06:18,783 --> 00:06:20,983
Come on, give me some time.

122
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:22,066
What's up?

123
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:24,666
Alyx: Yep, they got the reactor, easy peasy.

124
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,583
Alyx: I'm headed back to the safehouse right now to meet dad.

125
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,500
(Sirens blaring)

126
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,383
Alyx: Go! We'll be in touch.

127
00:06:30,383 --> 00:06:32,850
Unknown person: Stay safe.

128
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,116
Unknown person: Alyx, over here!
Alyx: What is it?

129
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:37,433
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

130
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,750
Unknown person: This doesn't seem like a routine sweep.

131
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,166
Unknown person: Are you sure everything went okay?

132
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,866
Alyx: One hundred percent.

133
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:46,100
Combine: Come on through.

134
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,083
Unknown person: Something's got the CPs riled up.

135
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,283
Alyx: Keep your head down and be smart.

136
00:06:52,283 --> 00:06:54,633
(Something caused the game to freeze, more into this soon)
Is everyone okay?

137
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,683
Combine: You. Get in the van.

138
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,716
Combine: We got 'em.

139
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,033
Huh?

140
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:05,850
Who's that?

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,550
Why were you looking at me weird?

142
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,016
What the fuck?

143
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:19,166
Are you all right there?

144
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,683
Are you all right, man?

145
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:29,083
There we go.

146
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:34,433
Combine: Behind you! Hands up! Don't move!

147
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:37,366
Alyx: Whoa whoa whoa whoa, wait wait wait!
I just... I just live here!

148
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:39,733
Combine: Probable Anti-Citizen.
Get those hands up! Get a scan.

149
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:42,800
Alyx: Wait w-wait wait. Don't shoot!
Combine: Area secure.

150
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,933
Combine: Bring him in.

151
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,316
Holy shit.

152
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:52,933
Combine: She's clean.

153
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,133
Combine: Give us names.
Eli: We didn't steal anything!

154
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,500
(So, I crashed right here.)

155
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,866
(The PC at the time of stream was facing a series of fatal issues,
this crash was one of them.)

156
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:02,500
(I recommend checking out my latest Devlog vid
for more context regarding my PC.)

157
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,133
(Apologies for the inconvenience.
Let's return to the regular programming.)

158
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:05,600
Quack!

159
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,983
I think we're back.

160
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:09,966
Combine: What is that?
INCOMING!
What?

161
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:12,916
Combine: GRENADE!
Get it!
I don't see it!
It's under the seat!
I'm looking, I'm looking!

162
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:16,550
Combine: Get it, get it, get it!
I got it!
Throw it, throw it-
I'm throwing it n-

163
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,683
Holy.

164
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:30,466
Drone: YOU-HAVE-BEEN-IN-AN-ACCIDENT.

165
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:33,966
Drone: TAKE-THE-HEADSET.

166
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:35,933
Huh?

167
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,116
What's in here?

168
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:44,116
Russell: Alyx! You there? You-You've got to get moving.

169
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,250
Alyx: Russell? I've been in an accident.

170
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,450
Russell: I know! I caused it!

171
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,883
Alyx: Wait. Where's dad?

172
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:52,983
Russell: He's fine. Follow the drone.

173
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:55,266
Oh?

174
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:03,183
Alyx: Do we know where they're takign him?
Russell: Criminal holding.

175
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:07,816
Russell: And then when they realize he's Eli Vance…
to Nova Prospekt.

176
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:10,450
Russell: But I'm already waiting on a plan to get him back.
Mel: Can I just... wait...

177
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,450
Russell: You're close to my lab.

178
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,250
Jump indicator?

179
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,066
I'm trying to understand.

180
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:29,283
What in the world do they mean by jumping indicator?

181
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,133
Oh, okay.

182
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,500
That's what you're supposed to be doing.

183
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,066
Okay, I get it now.

184
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:47,683
Oh, scheiße (shit)!

185
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:56,100
Fuck.
Russell: Alyx, everything cut out for a second!
I lost the headset video feed. Can you see my drone? Is it okay?

186
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,266
Alyx: Uh, sure. Yeah. I'll be there in a minute.

187
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:07,733
What the fuck is this?

188
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:13,000
Russell: Alyx, great. Okay, let's - wait. My drone's okay, right?

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,533
Mel: Nope.
Alyx: Nope. It exploded. I'm fine, by the way.

190
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:22,133
Russell: But. The good news is, we've got something they dont.

191
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:23,566
Alyx: Which is...?

192
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:26,966
Russell: My plan to get him back!
Alyx: Great. Let's hear it.

193
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:29,700
Russell: Now. Pretty soon they're gonna realize 
that your dad is not gonna talk.

194
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,033
Russell: And when THAT happens, he's off
to have his brain sucked out.

195
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,533
Alyx: Russell.
Russell: Potentially.

196
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,233
Russell: Maybe not, though. I mean, he could-
they could -
they could just drill into his-
Alyx: Stop.

197
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:37,966
Russell: Oh, yep. Still your dad.

198
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:41,966
Russell: Well, what they WILL do is take him by train from HERE.

199
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:45,916
Russell: This is Eli... to Nova Prospekt.

200
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:49,450
Alyx: And if he gets on that train… that's it, right?

201
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,116
So we hijack the train?
Russell: Not necessarily. Grab something that represents us.

202
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:55,500
Huh.

203
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,233
Russell: Yeah, just grab anything.

204
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,433
"Anything", you say.

205
00:11:04,716 --> 00:11:07,833
This?
Russell: Okay, that's you.

206
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:12,733
Russell: You take your train, get there before his train,
and hack into the controls.

207
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:17,966
Russell: That'll let me take over the system.
Train comes to a halt. You deal with the Combine situation.

208
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:19,166
Russell: And we get your dad back.
Mel: Huh.

209
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,883
Alyx: Sounds good. Where's the train I'm taking?

210
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,916
Russell: Out the back, through the yard.
It's decommissioned, but I think I can hack into it's controls.

211
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,883
Russell: Oh. And get yourself a pair of "Russells" on the way out.

212
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:30,883
Huh?
Alyx: "Russells"?

213
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,283
Russell: The gloves, Alyx. You know, the gravity gloves.
I have a few sets through there.

214
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:38,433
Russell: You can calibrate them out by the shed.
Alyx: Got it.

215
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:40,200
Russell: We can do this, Alyx.
Mel: Huh?

216
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,366
Russell: You got that, didn't you? That I said we could do it?
'Cause we're gonna do it.
Alyx: Yeah, we are.

217
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:49,066
Russell: I'm with you every step of the way.

218
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:51,533
Woah.

219
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,433
Okay.

220
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:55,866
All right.

221
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,983
I don't know how I'm supposed to be walking out, but you know.

222
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,666
(Glass smashed)

223
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,183
What did I do?

224
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:10,333
Russell: Aim at something with your hand open.

225
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,233
Russell (semi muted): Yep, you're tethered. Make a grip.

226
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,533
Russell: You've got it. Just a little flick of the wrist.
Catch it.

227
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,733
Whoa.

228
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,616
Russell: Boom, yep. Try again.

229
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,666
I almost froze the game.

230
00:12:25,883 --> 00:12:27,216
Russell: That's it. We're done.

231
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:29,816
Russell: Ooh! Oh, wait! I-I almost forgot.

232
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,200
Russell: Alyx! Up here! You're gonna need a gun!

233
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,033
Russell: Don't worry, it's unloaded!

234
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:35,616
(Gun shot windshield)

235
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:38,433
Russell: It's unloaded now!

236
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:41,283
Really??

237
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:47,283
Russell: Oh. Almost forgot, guns need ammo.

238
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,383
Russell: Here you go!

239
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,633
(Steam achievement)

240
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,883
"Catch Russell's guns ammo before he hits the ground."

241
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:57,166
Oh, that's an achievement?

242
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,783
No fucking way.

243
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,733
(Gun shot)

244
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:06,566
Russell: Oh, you uh, took care of that lock, then. Good. Great.

245
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:09,583
(So, I crashed again. I swear it won't happen again)

246
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:14,616
Russell: (I) Did have the key for it.
But should've given you that, that's...
that's on me.

247
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:19,950
Russell: Hello, Alyx? We MIGHT have a problem. Probably
nothing to worry about, but-

248
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,633
What is it?

249
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,200
Russell: Did the train stop? It stopped, didn't it.

250
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,683
Alyx: Yeah, what happened?

251
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:30,700
Russell: Ugh, it's jammed. When the Combine shut down
the Quarantine Zone, they might have tightened security.

252
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:33,066
Wurgh...

253
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:35,133
Who the fuck is that?

254
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:39,000
Alyx: I got a dead zombie here. I-I though the Combine sealed up the QZ?

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,283
Russell: Ah, this one must've squirted out. I heard they've had
trouble with barnacle spores outside the containment area.

256
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:47,750
Russell: But not about fellas like this.

257
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:55,216
Russell: Ahh... Would you look at that. Resin.
And if there's resin around here,
there should be a Combine fabricator.

258
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:59,533
Russell: Keep an eye out,
we might be able to upgrade your firepower a bit.

259
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:07,433
Oh, um...

260
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:12,250
"Use the multi-tool on the power source."
Alyx: Huh, I think I can reroute this with my multi-tool.

261
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:18,433
Russell: Your what?
Alyx: It's a tool with multiple functions. So, you know - multi-tool.

262
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,933
I don't get it.

263
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:23,283
Oh, we stick the gun in or something?

264
00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:25,100
No?

265
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:28,166
Oh, wait, it's right here.

266
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:37,383
Oh, it's a puzzle, innit?

267
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,466
Oh.

268
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,483
Okay, okay, I see.

269
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:51,816
So we're- so we're gonna-

270
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:55,566
Russell: Alyx, that thing's incredible!
You need an incredible brand name!
Mel: Ooh.

271
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:58,866
Russell: Something that really sells it!
Alyx: Who am I gonna sell it to?

272
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:02,866
Russell: The Combine's not going to be here forever.
You should be thinking about the future, Alyx!

273
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:07,666
Alyx: Well, how about I call it the "Alyx"?

274
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:13,383
Russell: Hmm. It's a little derivative of the "Russells", but yeah...
Provisionally, sure, the "Alyx".

275
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,133
Alyx: Yeah, the "Alyx".

276
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:22,533
Russell: Oh! A health station.
Alyx: Russell... the Combine use these. Are they safe for people

277
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:31,683
Russell: Yeah, they're great. Look, honestly.
Just pull the handle and put your hand in there.

278
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,633
Alyx: Hey... you were right. These are great.

279
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:56,016
So they squish these headcrabs to heal.

280
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:01,733
Can I try again?

281
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,850
That's it.

282
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,250
They look fine.

283
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,433
"Pick up heavy objects with both hands."

284
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,600
Russell: Careful of that barnacle, Alyx.

285
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,750
Oah.

286
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:28,983
That's a barnacle, huh?

287
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,233
Ew.

288
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,116
Ew, they're fucking gross.

289
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,466
So, we were up there.

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,250
Russell: Yeah, yeah, that's where they keep it.

291
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,250
Alyx: I'lllook around for a control panel to open it up.

292
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:05,916
Oh, are we supposed to climb in there?

293
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,033
Ugh.

294
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:14,316
He's- he's fucking awake!

295
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:16,966
Right? No?

296
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:19,183
Just to be safe.

297
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:20,216
Yep.

298
00:17:20,216 --> 00:17:22,483
He's fucking dead.

299
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,633
Push and hold...

300
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:30,933
...while moving.

301
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,150
Okay.

302
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,816
But I think it'll be better if we can push him out.

303
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:41,916
Fuck... off!

304
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,366
Just in case.

305
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,933
Oh hey, control panel.

306
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:50,666
Ooh.

307
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,866
I expect it to have a screen.

308
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,366
Yep.

309
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,416
That's a screen, alright.

310
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,700
Now we just have to power it up.

311
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,883
I assume.

312
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:12,583
So we're supposed to navigate our way to-

313
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,283
There we go.

314
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:19,716
Stay there.

315
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:25,716
No!

316
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:29,283
Stay right there.

317
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:34,816
Oh, that's what it needs!

318
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,383
Like that.

319
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:51,383
Just a little- there we go.

320
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,166
Okay.

321
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,533
Ooh.

322
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:59,516
Alright.

323
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,033
Awh, what the fuck?

324
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:09,166
What in the fuck are these?

325
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:18,633
Oh!

326
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:28,616
Alyx: Oh boy.

327
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:31,183
Russell: Yeah. That's... That's the way we gotta go.
Mel: That's a zombie.

328
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:35,966
Alyx: No shortcut?
Russell: Yeah, that IS the shortcut.

329
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:39,833
Hopefully, no Combine is in the way.

330
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,966
Can you be dead for once?

331
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:45,633
Russell: Alright, that seems to work. Let's keep doing that.

332
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,366
It would be nice if we could wear it on.

333
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:55,716
Oh, we can! Holy!

334
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:57,616
That's so cool!

335
00:19:57,616 --> 00:19:59,666
Oh, oh right.

336
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,316
I do not bode well with horror games, honestly, game.

337
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:07,033
Whoever I was speaking to.

338
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:12,083
Oh!

339
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:21,983
Jeez.

340
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:23,116
When are you gonna be dead?

341
00:20:23,116 --> 00:20:25,283
Fuck's sake!

342
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:28,366
Russell: I think that's a Combine fabricator.

343
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:32,383
Russell: Put something in it. I want to see how this thing works.
Alyx: Got it.

344
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:38,450
Ooooh.

345
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:43,483
We get it close enough and all points meet. There we go.

346
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,116
Okay?

347
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,833
Put the gun in the cradle.

348
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,966
Alyx: Enh, I don't have enough resin for any of this stuff.

349
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:56,966
Russell: Ah, well you know what they say about resin, Alyx.

350
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,933
Alyx: No. What do they say about resin, Russ?

351
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:04,283
Russell: Um. "Look... for... m-more resin".

352
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:10,583
Alyx: Ohhh-kay. I'll keep an eye out.
Russell: Yeah, that's the one... "Look for more resin".

353
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,683
There's three shots.

354
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:15,666
Never mind, he's agro-ed.

355
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,250
That's bad.

356
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:26,316
We really should have used it.

357
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,483
Shut that door.

358
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:32,583
No, fuck's sake!

359
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,066
Okay, keep running.

360
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,283
No, that's even worse!

361
00:21:38,283 --> 00:21:40,933
We got another one!

362
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:43,533
Quickly!

363
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,416
I don't got anything!

364
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:49,683
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

365
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,883
Run while we can.

366
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:01,733
Did it work?

367
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,816
Oh my god, we're THAT low in health?

368
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:11,866
No freaking way!

369
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,266
Okay.

370
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:22,500
Hopefully no more zombies.

371
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,416
'cause...

372
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,633
I'm genuinely out of ammo.

373
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:32,233
Am I just really screwed for once?

374
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:39,566
No, that's a fucking resin!

375
00:22:40,183 --> 00:22:41,983
This guy!

376
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:44,083
Fuck!

377
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,216
Oh.

378
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:09,183
What…

379
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,266
is that?

380
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,466
It looks quite like there's a strong presence of something in here.

381
00:23:15,466 --> 00:23:20,200
Alyx: Russell, are you seeing this?
Russell: Ah, possibly. Are you seeing floating garbage?

382
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Alyx: It looks like it's just... cardboard.
Russell: Right. Well, seems harmless.
Alyx: Yeah. Weird, though.

383
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,483
Huh...

384
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,616
Mel: Whoa.
Alyx: What IS that?

385
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,516
It's like a cult.

386
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:45,033
I wonder what does it do?

387
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:57,033
Okay, so we need to press the right combination. Gotcha.

388
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:04,233
There should only be one box
that has three (*two) of the combinations, right?

389
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:07,916
Is there anything I'm missing here?

390
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:10,566
Wait.

391
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:12,766
Is it trying to tell us something?

392
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:16,283
Is it trying to tell us that these two are the keys itself?

393
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:18,783
Just two buttons.

394
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:20,966
Is that it?

395
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:27,016
Because I can see two lights, so that means…

396
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:28,750
this…

397
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,650
and…

398
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,366
this. (gasp)

399
00:24:35,566 --> 00:24:39,933
Mel: All right.
Overwatch: Attention please. Access is not permitted.

400
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:46,983
Overwatch: Anti-citizen scavenging will result
in immediate capital prosecution.

401
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:52,416
Russell: Alyx! You alright? What's wrong?
Alyx: I'm fine, Russell, what's up?

402
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:56,116
Russell: I'm losing your signal! Alyx? Alyx?

403
00:24:56,116 --> 00:25:00,666
Russell: If you can still hear me, keep heading in the same direction,
and-and try to get above ground!

404
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,700
Alyx: Russell? Russell?

405
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:09,250
Alyx: Whoa, this is weird.

406
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:14,150
This is definitely weird.

407
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:17,333
Oh, is this their entry point?

408
00:25:20,783 --> 00:25:21,700
Alyx: Oh.

409
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,650
Vortigaunt: The Alyx Vance!
Mel: Ah.

410
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:31,283
Vortigaunt: You received my messages!
Alyx: I did?

411
00:25:31,283 --> 00:25:35,583
Mel: Huh.
Vortigaunt: Come! Enter.
Alyx: Okay...

412
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,983
Alyx: Thanks.
Vortigaunt: You are welcome!

413
00:25:39,983 --> 00:25:46,183
Alyx: So, what's a Vortigaunt doing here?
Vortigaunt: (sniffs) Mmm!
Mel: Uoh.

414
00:25:46,183 --> 00:25:51,683
Vortigaunt: Cooking!
Alyx: Right, but I mean in general.

415
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:54,733
Vortigaunt: I have a brain injury.

416
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:56,833
Alyx: Oh. I'm sorry to-
Vortigaunt: My brain is injured!

417
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:59,533
Alyx: That's terrible, and I hope-
Vortigaunt: Ow.

418
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:02,816
Alyx: Look, I'm actually pretty busy looking for my father...

419
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:08,016
Alyx: ...Eli Vance...
Vortigaunt: The… Eli Vance! Yes.

420
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:11,083
Alyx: The Combine have him, and I really do need to get moving.

421
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:17,066
Vortigaunt: The Combine. Yes. Do not go yet!
I must show you something!

422
00:26:17,066 --> 00:26:18,883
Alyx: Look, I appreciate-
Vortigaunt: This way!

423
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:22,200
Alyx: I can't stick around, I-
Vortigaunt: It is important! 

424
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:29,716
Alyx: I'm sure it is, but-
Vortigaunt: The Alyx Vance must go this way anyway…

425
00:26:29,716 --> 00:26:33,216
Alyx: Okay.
Mel: (sigh)

426
00:26:34,783 --> 00:26:36,766
Oh.

427
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:39,533
So he's the magic…

428
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:41,833
sorcerer.

429
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:51,700
Vortigaunt: The Combine have other of my kin.

430
00:26:54,616 --> 00:26:58,700
So I assume these cardboards are rebuilt of these guys then.

431
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,466
Vortigaunt: Held, like the Eli Vance.

432
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:07,333
Vortigaunt: The Alyx Vance will free them!

433
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:10,216
Alyx: I would help. I really would.

434
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:15,566
Mel: He's trying to tell a story.
Alyx: But the Alyx Vance is honestly very busy saving her Dad.

435
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:18,700
Vortigaunt: You will not save him. He is dead.

436
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,683
Alyx: What?
Vortigaunt: Or he will be...
Alyx: Is? Or will be?

437
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:30,733
Vortigaunt: It is a matter of perspective.
But Alyx Vance alone cannot prevent his fate.

438
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:35,966
Alyx: I- Look. Thank you for... everything. But I really have to go.

439
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:40,116
Alyx: And I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for riddles.

440
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:52,016
Vortigaunt: No riddles! The Combine drilled here.
I do not know when I am.
I am severed from the Vortessence. I am alone in my head.

441
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:03,033
Alyx: I'm sorry. Look, if I can, if I run across your friends, I will see what I can do.

442
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:06,750
Vortigaunt: You have saved my kin!
Alyx: I... havent.

443
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,083
Vortigaunt: Then you will.

444
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,650
Vortigaunt: Rraaagh!

445
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,666
Vortigaunt: Courage, Alyx Vance!

446
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:19,083
Thank you.

447
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:28,133
Vortigaunt: I will help the Alyx Vance! Look to the Northern Star. 

448
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:30,033
Alyx: Why?
Vortigaunt: For guidance!

449
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:38,583
Alyx: Okay. Thanks. Are you done? Helping?
Vortigaunt: I am not! Here. Sustenance!

450
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:46,733
Alyx: Uh... I'll eat it later. Thanks for the help.
Vortigaunt: You will be welcome.

451
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:48,816
I'm even more impressed that this guy…

452
00:28:48,816 --> 00:28:51,533
this gentleman's a lot more friendly than I thought.

453
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:55,483
Russell: Alyx! Alyx! The signal's back! Can you hear me? Are you okay?

454
00:28:55,483 --> 00:29:00,533
Alyx: Russell! I'm good! How's Dad?
Russell: They've got him on the train. He's on the move.

455
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:05,416
Russell: You gotta find Fairview Junction before they get there.
Alyx: I'm working on it.

456
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:12,116
Russell: So anything happen when you cut out?
Alyx: You're not gonna believe this, but I ran into a Vortigaunt.

457
00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:18,266
Russell: A Vortigaunt? What was he doing down there?
Alyx: Hiding. I think he escaped from the Combine.

458
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:24,833
Russell: W-what did he say?
Alyx: You ever meet a Vortigaunt? He said crazy Vortigaunt stuff.

459
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:28,516
Heh, okay.

460
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,450
Perfect.

461
00:29:33,183 --> 00:29:37,916
I wish we had a more of a melee weapon that we can use.

462
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,833
Let's go.

463
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:48,216
'kay, that opens it instantenously.

464
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:52,150
Alyx: Oh, that Vortigaunt I met? He did give me a headcrab to eat.

465
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:57,650
Russell: Oh! Great! What did it taste like? Tell me how you f-
Alyx: Russell. Russell- I didn't eat it.

466
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,150
Russell: Right. Of course you didn't.
No, that's... that's the right decision.

467
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,533
Yeah...

468
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:07,116
We're not the same species to begin with.

469
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:11,066
Alyx: Oh! That zombie has a shotgun!

470
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:14,500
Mel: (heave)
Alyx: Come on...

471
00:30:15,316 --> 00:30:17,366
Wait...

472
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:21,883
Oh, shotgun pellets.

473
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:26,183
Why is it clinging onto him to begin with. What the heck?

474
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,883
Just to be safe...

475
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:43,233
Ow...

476
00:30:43,283 --> 00:30:45,333
Fuck.

477
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,533
Alright.

478
00:30:49,549 --> 00:31:01,766
Idiot Mel tries to (not) get the shotgun for 10 minutes gay.

479
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:04,250
It's not like we can…

480
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,633
Are you serious, game?

481
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:11,866
It wasn't… It didn't allow me to do that earlier.

482
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:14,666
So, we wedge it in there...

483
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,483
So in theory…

484
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:19,533
There.

485
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:25,900
Now, we don't need to use the gravity gun
because we can just reach it for it.

486
00:31:26,616 --> 00:31:27,950
Perfect.

487
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,366
"Open shotgun."

488
00:31:37,483 --> 00:31:40,016
"Pull slider."

489
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,783
Oh, there you are.

490
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:57,266
Russell: I love this gun.

491
00:31:59,366 --> 00:32:01,783
How much do we have?

492
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:04,516
Ooh.

493
00:32:04,516 --> 00:32:07,466
Screw it. We'll make good use of it.

494
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,200
So, there's gonna be a machine and this guy.

495
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:15,400
Oh, more of you!

496
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:27,483
Uwah!

497
00:32:27,483 --> 00:32:29,683
Fuck!

498
00:32:33,866 --> 00:32:35,866
Phew.

499
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:38,833
Oh.

500
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:45,883
Did you see that?

501
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:48,516
Hol' up.

502
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:54,700
Oh, so that's what that was for.

503
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,816
The thing I threw away and…

504
00:32:56,816 --> 00:33:01,816
Awh, we can't use it because we don't got the thingy.

505
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:05,083
Awh, fuck.

506
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:08,283
We should've carried one with us.

507
00:33:09,216 --> 00:33:10,333
There we go.

508
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,416
Wonderful.

509
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:12,816
We've unlocked it.

510
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:14,316
Huh, neat.

511
00:33:14,316 --> 00:33:17,983
I would love to upgrade the shotgun
but we're that low on ammo so…

512
00:33:17,983 --> 00:33:20,733
Don't think that's gonna be feasible for me.

513
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:25,583
"Reflex sight. Adds a display that highlights tactical targets."

514
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,083
No.

515
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,516
Maybe shotgun?

516
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:29,900
What's for the shotgun?

517
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,450
"Laser sight. Adds laser projector for better targeting."

518
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:36,383
Oh?

519
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:41,916
Oh, they stack.

520
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:44,116
That's interesting.

521
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:52,733
Oh, neat.

522
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:55,066
Russell: Oh! That should come in handy.

523
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,433
Oops.

524
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,083
All right.

525
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:01,033
We'll progress from here on the next stream.

526
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:03,266
All right, with that said.

527
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:05,000
Thank you so much for watching.

528
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,566
Be sure to subscribe.

529
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:10,983
And this is my first time trying out a completely different game so…

530
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:13,566
I hope you genuinely enjoy what I do.

531
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:19,966
I kind of want to span out and try as many variety games as I can.

532
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:25,166
Be it VR games, computer games,
like any sorts of games that I can imagine.

533
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:29,516
So if you got any suggestions for any other games,
please let me know.

534
00:34:29,516 --> 00:34:32,683
Because I would look forward to trying it.

535
00:34:32,683 --> 00:34:34,666
Check out my Patreon [*Ko-fi].

536
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:35,966
That's another way to support me.

537
00:34:35,966 --> 00:34:38,800
And I also do have my personal commentary,

538
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,750
like what's been going on with me and stuff like that.

539
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,183
I don't really like talking about it

540
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:46,333
on the community posts or on Bluesky.

541
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:49,433
So I usually like talking about it on Patreon [*Ko-fi] instead.

542
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:53,033
So this is where I would be getting really down to earth

543
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:54,500
and honest about myself.

544
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,433
And also be check on my Discord

545
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:59,866
because that too is another way I get a little bit down to earth.

546
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:05,566
But less concise and just more short things here and there.

547
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:08,466
With that said, thank you so much for watching.

548
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:09,466
It's ya girl, Melori.

549
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:12,316
And I'll bid you a farewell.

550
00:35:12,316 --> 00:35:13,833
Otsu-Melo deshita.

551
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:16,566
See ya!

552
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:26,683
