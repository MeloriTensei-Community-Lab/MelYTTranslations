1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,630
Well hey, look who's home.

2
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,880
It's your good ol' little PC-kun.

3
00:00:17,883 --> 00:00:19,980
(Grunts) Come on in.

4
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:23,510
(Home is where the circuits rest.)
God dammit, I've missed you for so long.

5
00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:25,160
(A connection reestablished, a home coming complete.)
Right, let's get her rolled in,

6
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,660
and let's get her installed.

7
00:00:29,383 --> 00:00:30,230
It's been a while.

8
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,960
Hey guys, it's ya girl, MeloriTensei,

9
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:36,560
and let's get straight to the devlog for August 2024.

10
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:38,200
So one of the greatest good news is

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,180
that the PC's not dead anymore, as you can see.

12
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:41,530
I am finally back.

13
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:45,540
Ey, I'm on VRChat and I'm finally doing VRChat things.

14
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:48,350
I don't, uh, to be honest, I don't really know.

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,850
So to those who haven't watched my mousemat video,

16
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,510
here's the short form of what happened.

17
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:57,230
I sent the computer to the technician

18
00:00:57,233 --> 00:01:00,850
and it took them 9 days to figure out what went wrong.

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,200
So basically what went wrong is that,

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,130
so the PSU has been pretty worn out

21
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:09,530
and it has been involved in a really massive accident many many years ago

22
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,930
that surprisingly slipped past my mind.

23
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:16,730
It's a long time ago, naive Melori accidentally mismatched power supply cables

24
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:21,030
and that caused some brrrrrrrrrrrrrr magic smoke.

25
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:24,260
And I thought what broke is probably just my GPU

26
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:26,000
and I didn't think of it too much.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,150
But I didn't expect that it even blew up

28
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,230
the power supply safety feature as well.

29
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:33,280
So, the safety feature for the PSU is pretty busted.

30
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:37,230
And add salt to injury, the warranty for the PSU is pretty void

31
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:41,580
because naive Mel opened up the power supply to clean the fan.

32
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:44,610
So, the warranty is more or less void

33
00:01:44,616 --> 00:01:48,410
because we don't have legislations here defending against

34
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,680
the warranty sticker here.

35
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:55,590
So, I pretty much have no choice but to accept defeat more or less.

36
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,730
However, with a little bit of money to gather around,

37
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,960
special thanks to my Ko-fi donators.

38
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:06,650
Thank you all so so so so much for giving me even the slightest bit of money

39
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,280
that allows me to be able to afford at least a power supply

40
00:02:10,283 --> 00:02:11,810
that can hold me off for at least

41
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:15,560
probably a year or two and keep going with content creation.

42
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:19,960
So, I thank you very very very very much.

43
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,030
But with that said, I'm still looking forward

44
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,960
to get a properly decent power supply

45
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:26,980
and you can check out my Throne for the actual power supply

46
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:28,980
that I'm looking forward to upgrade to.

47
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,880
I'll show that on the screen and feel free to donate

48
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:33,840
if you would like to keep me alive

49
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:36,680
for a little bit longer, I guess.

50
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:38,800
But yeah, speaking of setups however,

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,760
I have decided that I kinda wanna try

52
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:44,210
messing around with ASMRs a little more.

53
00:02:44,216 --> 00:02:46,830
So although the view count isn't that much

54
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,860
in comparison to all my other videos,

55
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:53,960
I still kinda wanna adventure into various different kinds of triggers and

56
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:58,530
in ASMRs and maybe start to get into the more serious ASMR stuff.

57
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:04,080
However, I don't really have a 3Dio or any binaural mics of the sort

58
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:08,400
so please do check out my Throne because I do plan to pick up a binaural mic.

59
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,900
However, I don't have the funds for it

60
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,800
so if you would like to fund my ASMR journey,

61
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,060
feel free to check that out there.

62
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:15,410
But for the time being, I'm using the Razer Seiren

63
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:19,610
to make up some of the ASMR stereo vibes, I guess,

64
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,110
and there are still plenty of things to think about.

65
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:26,630
So namely setup, I'm recently kinda working on getting comfortable

66
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:30,680
with the setup with my laptop recording setup to be able to record ASMRs in

67
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:35,080
and I kinda settled to NOT record them in my studio room ever.

68
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,010
This one right here.

69
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,360
Because if you have watched my ASMR trigger test video,

70
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:41,010
*bonk*

71
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:44,410
you would realize that that room is actually my bedroom.

72
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:48,010
Fuck's sake. This table sucks. (lmao)

73
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:50,080
And even that, with the air conditioner on,

74
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:54,210
it's making quite some noise so I don't think it would make sense

75
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:58,180
to record in a studio room with the computer fan going like crazy.

76
00:03:58,183 --> 00:04:00,130
So, plenty of improvement has to be done,

77
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:03,010
including getting something to display my laptop

78
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:05,080
so I'll be able to control my OBS from there,

79
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,090
while keeping the laptop outside the room

80
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,110
so there won't be jet engine noises.

81
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,150
Right, getting onto MeloriTensei's video.

82
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,440
So what's next for MeloriTensei's video now that the PC is back?

83
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:16,630
So, I currently got a huge backlog of videos

84
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:19,640
that I planned to make but did not manage to

85
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,730
because the PC went poof.

86
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:25,440
So, now I'm gonna try to catch up to all of them.

87
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,110
And as of recording this video,

88
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:29,960
I have successfully done a few tasks

89
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:32,930
that I have mentioned in the [YT] Community Posts.

90
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,360
Please do keep an eye on my Discord and Community Posts

91
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:38,330
for more updates for some of the behind the scenes stuff.

92
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,380
But as for my videos, I'm planning to make some stream highlights

93
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:45,580
for contents that I've been wanting to make for quite a long time.

94
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,390
So, gaming stream highlights, namely one of them,

95
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,910
because recently I found myself to be burning out

96
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,480
a little teeny tiny bit and I've been running...

97
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:53,110
kind of,

98
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:54,330
I wouldn't say out of ideas,

99
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,680
more like kind of out of feasible methods to achieve

100
00:04:57,683 --> 00:04:59,480
some of these ideas I have in my head.

101
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:04,000
So I kind of need more breathing room to create some of the ideas out

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,610
and hopefully ensure the quality stays pretty much the same

103
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:10,230
throughout the videos in the past to the present

104
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:11,610
or maybe even better.

105
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:14,610
I'm trying to make it better, not worse.

106
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:18,760
So hopefully you would spare me some more time for some of the tech videos,

107
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:22,160
be a little patient with me because there's a lot of prep work going on

108
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,430
and it's a little bit hard to prep these days.

109
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:26,510
So hopefully I can fill up that gap

110
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:29,460
with some gaming stream highlights.

111
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:32,080
Not to mention, I kind of do want to expand my videos

112
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,850
to not just tech but also some gaming highlights

113
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,880
so it can cater to the general audience and gaming fans I guess,

114
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:43,080
on top of just tech fans because laser focusing

115
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:47,280
on a certain demographic is not exactly my favorite thing

116
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:48,610
to do all the time.

117
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:51,010
However, I don't really have that much choice.

118
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:52,880
Not to mention, I do kind of enjoy gaming.

119
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:56,980
So, think of it as like an addition to my channel, I guess.

120
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:59,630
That way, this should allow my channel to continue breathing

121
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:02,080
while still having content pumping out every week,

122
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,610
all while still giving me breathing room for research

123
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:07,380
for the tech videos that I'm planning to make eventually

124
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,430
and also slide into one of the weeks.

125
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:13,640
Also to prevent future burnouts, I'm temporarily suspending

126
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:18,580
this "sussy site" that I have mentioned in my previous devlog

127
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:22,360
because recently I've found myself not being able to catch up

128
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:25,140
to whatever work I want to do on that site.

129
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:29,760
Not to mention, it's not my primary focus to do "more than usual",

130
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:32,360
spicy content just yet

131
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:33,430
and I think, to myself,

132
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:36,980
something spicy is just something's on the side, I guess.

133
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:38,800
Not exactly my regular thing.

134
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,910
So I hope those who are looking forward to those sites

135
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,430
be a little patient with me.

136
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:44,890
And speaking of being patient with me,

137
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,230
I thank you all very very much for being patient with me

138
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:51,300
because in the past weeks I've been working on compiling editing assets

139
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,890
so it would be far easier for me to search for editing assets

140
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:56,180
for videos that I'll be making in the future.

141
00:06:56,183 --> 00:07:00,810
However, it has been getting really really taxing on me mentally

142
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:04,440
because of the sheer size of the assets I've collected.

143
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:07,560
So, I've only collected 75% of the first pack

144
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:10,210
but I hope I can make good use of it still myself

145
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:15,110
but my ultimate goal however is to make sure that I can gather all the assets

146
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:19,680
and I have, at least, 95% not needing to search

147
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:22,130
on the internet for assets anymore

148
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:26,280
and hopefully I can distribute it out so it would help future editors

149
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:29,310
and aspiring editors as well, not just myself.

150
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:33,280
I hope I'll be able to make it available for download when it's ready.

151
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:34,760
Now, if you're wondering why I didn't pull through

152
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:36,480
with doing 100% of all packets,

153
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:40,060
it's because there were 3 packs and they were massive.

154
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:43,080
And not to mention I'm feeling really guilty recently

155
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,630
for being on a hiatus for too long

156
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,380
and not pumping out any kind of content.

157
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,930
It's kind of killing my algorithm recently

158
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:51,510
and I don't really want to be forgotten.

159
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:55,260
So I decided to put a pause on sorting out assets for now

160
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,910
but I'll keep doing over time as I'm editing videos.

161
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,210
Right, getting onto the more uplifting news now.

162
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:02,630
I've said in my previous devlog

163
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:05,800
that I'll eventually be working on making my channel accessible

164
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,580
to Chinese viewers and Japanese viewers.

165
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:12,530
So as my first step, I've started opening up my Crowdin page.

166
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:16,050
So you can check out this website if you do want to volunteer

167
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,160
translating my subtitles into those languages.

168
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,410
That way, you would help upcoming viewers

169
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,010
to check out contents that I would be offering.

170
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:27,680
And I would also continue to commit making English subtitles

171
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,550
for all of my videos.

172
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,300
So this is not going to stop

173
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,660
and I'm going to keep making subtitles

174
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,430
because I want to make sure that all my viewers can kind of

175
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,040
get what I'm saying without relying on auto subtitles

176
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:41,830
because auto subtitles do suck a whole lot.

177
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,710
Currently on my Crowdin page, I've only covered 90% of my channel

178
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:48,710
at the moment because I've reached the free tier limit,

179
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:51,200
the word count of 60,000 words.

180
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,030
So once both languages have been translated completely,

181
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,730
I will delete those source files and I'll take the translations

182
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:00,540
and then put up the latest videos in as well.

183
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:03,010
So, people can translate those videos as well.

184
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:05,880
Now, if you're wondering how the hell would I get proofreaders

185
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:08,660
so I can make sure that the translation stays accurate,

186
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,460
I don't really have any plans for now,

187
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:15,200
but I'm looking forward to proofreaders who are looking to proofread

188
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,730
the translations that will be submitted to it's own page.

189
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:21,330
I'll be looking forward to getting applications for proofreaders

190
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,960
that are looking to proofread the translations on the Crowdin page

191
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:26,000
through my business email.

192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,010
Do check out my PinCushion down in the description below

193
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:29,110
for the business email.

194
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:31,540
My only simple requirements for becoming a proofreader

195
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:35,910
is to prove that you have a substantial evidence

196
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,930
that you're proficient in the language that you're applying for,

197
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:41,710
all without losing the vibes and the meaning that I'm saying.

198
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:45,580
Now, you don't need to submit your certifications or your degree or anything

199
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,640
because certification to me don't really matter.

200
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:50,630
True skill matters instead.

201
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:55,680
However, please do not submit ChatGPT-looking-ass submission

202
00:09:55,683 --> 00:09:57,760
because I won't be entertaining those

203
00:09:57,766 --> 00:10:00,140
because AI outputs just don't reflect

204
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:04,040
the actual vibes that us humans give out when we're speaking.

205
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:07,110
So that's it, I bid y'all good luck down in the description below.

206
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:10,600
Now for one last brighter news, I've updated my Throne wishlist

207
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,680
so there's far more items now in my wishlist.

208
00:10:12,683 --> 00:10:16,600
You have more choice in gifting me gifts that I have on my wishlist.

209
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,430
However, I've only added a small handful of stuff,

210
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:22,780
namely studio improvements like sound proofing panels

211
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:24,610
and random stuff that I want.

212
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:26,510
However, something still feels missing.

213
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:28,780
So please let me know in the comments below,

214
00:10:28,783 --> 00:10:31,760
let me know what suggestions I should add into my wishlist

215
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:34,810
and if I should go balls to the walls to the things that I want.

216
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:37,530
However, there is one tiny roadblock you may think to yourself.

217
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:38,880
"If I donate to the Throne,

218
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:43,160
wouldn't that mean I won't have access to my Ko-fi early access?"

219
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,760
Hello early access viewers~?

220
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:46,460
Well, fear not.

221
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:48,580
I've actually emailed Ko-fi support

222
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:52,390
and they gave me a greenlight to do this workaround.

223
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,390
So if you donate on Throne,

224
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,930
as long as I obtain certain information that I can contact you in some way,

225
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:01,680
say namely your email address or something,

226
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:04,310
then I'll contact you directly over email,

227
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:07,160
a code you can use on Ko-fi that will discount

228
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,360
an item on my shop on Ko-fi by 99%.

229
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:13,530
Which means you'll only need to pay a single yen fee

230
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,760
to enter my Ko-fi exclusive content.

231
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:17,780
Now if you're wondering why a single yen,

232
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:22,360
that's because Ko-fi currently does not have 100% discount coupon at the moment

233
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:26,360
and I've passed that suggestion to them so hopefully they start implementing that

234
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:29,830
and allow me to do that kind of workaround.

235
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,260
However, as of recording this video,

236
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,660
I have not tested if this feature currently works.

237
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,810
So your mileage may heavily vary

238
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:41,630
but hopefully sometime around in the future, I'll get this tested

239
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,760
and I'll let you know down in the comments below whether this feature worked.

240
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:47,980
If it worked, I'll announce it on my discord

241
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:52,110
and the comments below and also in my community post

242
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:54,980
so I'll do some tests and I'll let you know by then.

243
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:57,930
Now I hope to bring more blessings and upgrades to my channel

244
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:01,280
in the next devlog but I'm not sure when I'll have another devlog

245
00:12:01,283 --> 00:12:02,680
but there will be one,

246
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:07,000
if there's any major changes that can be compiled into one video like this.

247
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,180
But with that said, thank you all for believing in me

248
00:12:10,183 --> 00:12:12,530
and hopefully I'll be back soon.

249
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:15,780
After all the backlog videos, the streams will resume.

250
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:17,580
There, I said it.

251
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,860
With that said, please do financially support me on Ko-fi and Throne

252
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:24,760
and Otsu-Melo, catch you next time!

253
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,600
I, uhh, god...

254
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,530
I haven't had that much confidence in a while now.

255
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:36,510
Screw off, don't bother me.

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,110
Ohhh, don't change anything about that.

257
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:40,930
Don't change anything.

258
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:43,780
There we go, we got it. Perfect.

259
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,580
Okay.

260
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,230
My hands were frozen.

261
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:51,880
Finally, I can turn on the fan now!

262
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:53,860
Awh, it's so hot.

263
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:56,880
I'm just sweating like crazy right now.

264
00:12:56,883 --> 00:12:59,080
Fuck.

265
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:02,700
Cheers bloopers watchers. Cheers.

266
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,530
See ya.
