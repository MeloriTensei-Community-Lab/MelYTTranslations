1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,320
Is that a Supra?

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,920
Oh no!

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,440
Sorry, Taco Man!

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,520
New Fast and Furious movie looks lit!

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,640
You have not changed ever ANNA!

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,160
ANNA, I've listened to you 
since Forza Horizon 3 now!

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,760
God damn it, that guy!

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,680
Melori is Bri' 'ish!

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,218
Congrats, you played yourself!

10
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:29,960
Scott: Wait, is that a WINGSUIT?!

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,480
Why are you third wheeling me already?

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,080
Fuck off!

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,240
Ramiro, you're not cool Ramiro, not cool!

15
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:06,720
Ha!

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,920
We can now pick our starter cars, let's go!

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay, so that's the Corvette 
we were driving earlier.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,800
That's the Bronco we were driving as well.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,160
Is that a Supra?

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,280
Is that a Supra?

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,240
Dude, is that a Supra?

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Sorry, I gotta do that.

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,400
I gotta do that.

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,240
There's a Supra!

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,160
But I also like, I also like, 
I also like sports cars though.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,840
I like supercars.

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,400
You know what?

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,760
Fuck the Corvette, go with the Supra.

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,960
Okay, Supra it is, let's go!

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,280
Oh, this one has a Toyota engine.

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,600
Or is this rebadged?

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,800
Cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap.

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,840
Hard cap.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,440
This is, tell me this is a rebadge.

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,920
Tell me this is a rebadge.

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,960
I have a feeling that this is a Supra.

38
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:05,480
Oh, right, here we go.

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,240
Hmm, what can I do?

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,520
I love moms.

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,560
Love moms.

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,080
You know what?

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,840
YOUR MOM is much better.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,160
Don't you think?

45
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,840
So it fits all eight letters 
and it calls out everyone's mom.

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Should we go for that?

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,760
Should we go for that?

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,160
Should we go for that?

49
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,200
Oh my god.

50
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,000
I could not pass up this opportunity.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,840
"I swear to god, yes, yes."

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,680
Let's go!

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,280
Controller disagrees.

54
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:11,040
Oh, no!

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,920
I was not expecting that.

56
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:20,480
Wait, there's a filter!

57
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,720
Okay, we can't do YOUR MOM apparently.

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,880
Alright, okay.

59
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,720
We can't do YOUR MOM.

60
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,760
Hmm.

61
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,369
For now, we'll put this as a placeholder.

62
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,880
Oh no, it's Bass Arena again.

63
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,680
Oh, we have to stop.

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,200
The game should have told us to stop.

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,000
I just pressed on.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,720
I just pressed on.

67
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,320
Alright.

68
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,820
Wait.

69
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,840
What is coming?

70
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,160
It sounds like bikes.

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,040
Huh.

72
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,960
Sorry, taco man!

73
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,080
What are we dropping?

74
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,480
What are they dropping?

75
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,040
Bikers, of course!

76
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:02,442
Ah!

77
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,120
No!

78
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,040
I wasn't looking.

79
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,720
New Fast and Furious movie looks lit.

80
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,480
Introducing new Vin Diesel 
that crashes from time to time.

81
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,200
How invincible are these bicycles?

82
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,680
I gotta be honest, what the heck?

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,840
Vin Gasoline!

84
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,640
Vin Gasoline!

85
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,239
Vin Gasoline!

86
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,040
Nah, he's just taking a shortcut.

87
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,080
Don't worry about him.

88
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Woohoo!

89
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,560
What the fuck?

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,040
No!

91
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,440
What are they planning?

92
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,231
What are they planning?

93
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,640
Ayo, ayo!

94
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:00,560
Wee!

95
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,280
Oh my god, I'm just scratching it.

96
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,600
I'm just scratching away.

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,400
This is not first place, do you know that?

98
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,760
A parachute.

99
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,040
Do you know what's called a parachute?

100
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,600
Stunt Team - Special Cargo.

101
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,560
What an interesting "vehicle name".

102
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,240
"Special Cargo".

103
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,840
Oh, we're taking my Supra again.

104
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,440
Let's go.

105
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
Where are we heading?

106
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,280
Get out of the way!

107
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,021
God damn it!

108
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,697
Ergggghhhh!

109
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,560
Oh!

110
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,497
Oh, the drift!

111
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:39,360
Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy!
Holy shit!

112
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,760
That was unintentional.

113
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,840
But that was great.

114
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,280
That was sick.

115
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,365
Wait, we're supposed to turn left!

116
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:46,452
Eee!

117
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,440
You have not changed ever, ANNA.

118
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,800
I just realized about you.

119
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560
ANNA, I've listened to you 
since Forza Horizon 3 now.

120
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,960
Oh, okay.

121
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,880
Choose a story first, huh?

122
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,320
So, should we go for wild storms?

123
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,080
Or should we look for a barn vine?

124
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,120
VW, right!

125
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,620
Let's go!

126
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,840
But before that, can we get back 
inside the festival, though?

127
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,900
Oh, yes!

128
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,520
Please be quiet, ANNA.

129
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,720
Right, let's head back.

130
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,880
Let's get driving for real.

131
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,440
Let's have a calming, calm driving experience.

132
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,667
With absolutely no chaos.

133
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:49,240
Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy!
AHH!

134
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,120
God damn it, that guy!

135
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,430
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

136
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,737
AHH!

137
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:01,400
AHH!

138
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,640
Find a- oh.

139
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,840
Help Alejandra find an old car.

140
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,200
Right, we'll do that.

141
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:12,437
Huh.
AHH!

142
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:14,834
EH?!

143
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,440
Okay, okay, let's try to drive properly.

144
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,920
I've been watching and driving.

145
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,320
We're going to have another 
Samir moment at this point.

146
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,120
Samir!

147
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,400
Samir!

148
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,160
You're breaking the car!

149
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
Samir!

150
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,871
FAST SHARP RIGHT!

151
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,194
AHH!
AHH!

152
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:39,159
AHH!
I was reading  

153
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,880
the subtitles because she was speaking Spanish!

154
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,960
I like this.

155
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,800
For real, though.

156
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,680
I like this.

157
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,800
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

158
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,200
We're supposed to get in there.

159
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,860
Hey, yo.

160
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,173
Mel- Melori is Bri' 'ish.

161
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,040
I don't- I don't know if you 
can trust me with a truck.

162
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,760
Let alone driving a car.

163
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,960
"Don't worry, all you have to do 
is try not to Isekai someone."

164
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,410
I think we will have to Isekai a couple of 
grasses and- and- and- and- and electrical poles.

165
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,493
Nah, we'll jump it.

166
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,400
Get the Vocho back in the garage.

167
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
Wait a second, did I just miss it?

168
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,493
I was not looking at the map.

169
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:35,653
Oof.

170
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,480
"You missed the waypoint, bro."

171
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

172
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,320
Did I miss the waypoint?

173
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
Wait, where- where was it?

174
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,200
That's the destination?

175
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,160
Wait!

176
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,640
Shit!

177
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,880
Where was the waypoint?

178
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,671
Hold on, where was the waypoint?

179
00:09:54,314 --> 00:09:55,274
Oh-

180
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:07,720
I took it all the way to the festival!

181
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,280
I took it all the way to the festival!

182
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:21,150
"Congrats, you played yourself."

183
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,120
Oh my god!
"10 out of 10 driving skills", I know, right?

184
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,600
I was not even looking at the waypoint.

185
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,320
Thanks, chat.

186
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,040
Okay, let's- let's begin again.

187
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,480
This is why I love Forza.

188
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:51,640
You won't realize you get 
lost until someone tells you.

189
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,560
"There- there's a minimap on your left, bro."

190
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,920
I know, I know.

191
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,600
I'm aware.

192
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,760
I played- I played 3 and 4 and 
I- I know there's a minimap.

193
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,400
I just- I wasn't even looking.

194
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,920
"As a Forza expert, I'm disappointed in you."

195
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,074
I'm so sorry!

196
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:06,017
Hehehehe!

197
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,480
Okay, we're here.

198
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,038
"Nice, you didn't miss it this time."

199
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,800
Hehehehe!

200
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,160
Right, what- what should we do?

201
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,760
Should we do a normal event or should we do 
some collab events or should we do rally racing?

202
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
Let's start with this for now.

203
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,200
Yeah, let's do a little racing.

204
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,800
Right, let's get in the event.

205
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,520
Ooh, we can PvP!

206
00:11:28,684 --> 00:11:29,793
Or we can co-op.

207
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
Yeah, of course not PvP.

208
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,280
I- I haven't- I haven't gotten 
any car upgrades yet, so…

209
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,440
Hehehehe!

210
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,040
For sure, we're not going to PvP.

211
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,520
But- ooh, okay.

212
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,520
These- ooh, these cars that I have in hand, holy…

213
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,920
Okay, okay, okay.

214
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,840
I wanna take my Supra.

215
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,800
I wanna- I wanna- I wanna 
take my Supra because, um…

216
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,880
I wanna- I wanna have the- the 
genuine story effect, you know?

217
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,320
For every red team beaten.

218
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,240
Ooh…

219
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,240
Is this online or is it-

220
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,640
Oh, it's Drivatar.
Yeah, I can see- I can see the- the icon.

221
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,049
It says Drivatar.

222
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,600
It's a team tag, huh?

223
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,386
Alright.

224
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Ah, ah, ah!

225
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,240
I engage drifting too soon!

226
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,040
But we all know it's- this is Forza.

227
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,080
What- what do you expect?

228
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,640
Oh, shit!

229
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,680
I've touched it, right?

230
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,960
I've touched it, right?

231
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,760
Okay, I've touched it, so that means it worked.

232
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
It worked.

233
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,200
I didn't miss a thing.

234
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,520
No!

235
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
I'm losing them!

236
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,480
No- nononononono-

237
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,600
Oh, shit!

238
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,760
Oh my God, you're single-handedly carrying me!

239
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,440
I feel so bad for you, oh shit.

240
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,920
I gotta carry at least like- what?

241
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,600
100 points?

242
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,400
Come on.

243
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,105
Let me- let me carry a hundred points at least!

244
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:59,120
Shit!
くそ… (shit!)

245
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,360
Ah!

246
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,040
No!

247
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,320
Okay, I gotta look at the minimap.

248
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,640
I gotta pay attention to 
the minimap a little more.

249
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,920
Cause we don't have co-drivers, so…

250
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh shoot, oh shoot.

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,480
Ah!

252
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,360
Damn it!

253
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,040
All the cosmetic damage.

254
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,520
We're not fine.

255
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,720
This is what I say- what I call as Daijobu'nt.

256
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
No!

257
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Ah!

258
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,960
Oh no, I suck so bad!

259
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,200
Ah!

260
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,640
Ah!
Ah!

261
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,480
Ah!
Ah!

262
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,720
No!

263
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,000
Alright.

264
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,120
No, shoot!

265
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,560
The one second I look at 
the chat and then I'm gone.

266
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh shit!

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh shit, I'm too slow.

268
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,560
That was a really bad play!

269
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,120
Ah, shit!

270
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,847
Oh my God, I suck so bad at this.

271
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,619
Hahahahaha!
Hahahahaha!

272
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,120
Wait, your car is missing!

273
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,920
Wait, what?

274
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,760
Your car is missing on the top there.

275
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,280
What the heck happened?

276
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,920
DNF.

277
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,680
There's XP for not finishing?

278
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,040
Wow, okay.

279
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:33,800
Oh!

280
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,760
He disappeared!

281
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,480
He disappeared!

282
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,840
Go!

283
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,080
One is not like the other.

284
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,480
Everyone is having stock designs.

285
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Ah!

286
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,920
Nice driving, bro.

287
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,760
Let's go!

288
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,040
Weee!

289
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,376
Get out of the way!

290
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:05,775
Yee!

291
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:08,388
Wah!

292
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:09,880
Wah!

293
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,760
No!

294
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,040
Shit!

295
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,840
No!

296
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

297
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,720
I'm losing everyone!

298
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

299
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Oh shit!

300
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,640
Did I touch it?

301
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,880
Nope, I missed it.

302
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,400
So I lost all points just 
by falling off like that.

303
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,010
Oh, dang it.

304
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,760
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
Lesson learned.

305
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,600
Lean a little on the right, 
then turn left a little.

306
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,160
God, I suck so bad at this.

307
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,360
I was doing so well at first, and then 
everything just comes crashing down.

308
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,480
The moment I hit that wall earlier.

309
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,160
Oh no, there's the timer.

310
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,640
Out of the way!

311
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,040
Give me the points at least!

312
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,720
Touched it!

313
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,960
Let's go!

314
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,600
Ah!

315
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,560
Come on!

316
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,920
Let's go!

317
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,000
I got some points!

318
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,025
I carried some points!

319
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,840
Ah!

320
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,760
Oh my god, what was that dance?

321
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,360
That dance though!

322
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,600
It's that, it's that, it's my boo dance.

323
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,240
That, "at night, I think of you~".

324
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,309
Oh my god.
