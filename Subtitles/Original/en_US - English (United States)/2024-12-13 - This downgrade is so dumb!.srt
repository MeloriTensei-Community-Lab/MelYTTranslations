1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,160
Oh look, we got a brand new member of the family.

2
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:09,300
Kon-Melo, it's ya Tech Wizardess girl, MeloriTensei!

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,310
And today, we got a Samsung Galaxy A08.

4
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:17,430
Wait a second, that's an A06, not an 8.

5
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:19,430
God, I'm misremembering things.

6
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:22,060
And today, we got a Galaxy A06.

7
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:24,310
So let's get into the story right now.

8
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,860
So, MamaMel was looking for a new phone.

9
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:32,480
Because her current phone, the Galaxy S10 that I've mentioned some time ago,

10
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:34,380
in a few videos ago I guess,

11
00:00:34,383 --> 00:00:38,000
the battery degradation is getting worse.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,130
And it's starting to reach the point where it's unbearable

13
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:45,710
and carrying a battery bank is a necessity.

14
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:48,700
So she figured, well, it's been quite some time.

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,660
She's been holding onto the phone for like probably five years now.

16
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:56,730
So it's about time we get a phone change.

17
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,730
So we did some phone shopping.

18
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:02,860
And under my supervision, I kind of recommended a Nothing Phone 2a.

19
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:07,010
However, there is someone in the family that's not too thrilled

20
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:09,980
looking at the price of the Nothing Phone 2a.

21
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:11,460
And that's PapaMel.

22
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:15,010
PapaMel believes that the phone he's currently holding onto,

23
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:16,590
which we'll get to in a moment,

24
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,710
is too overpowered for his use.

25
00:01:18,716 --> 00:01:22,400
So he figured he should just hand down that phone to MamaMel

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,010
and he gets a far cheaper phone.

27
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:27,290
At this point, by the time you hear this,

28
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,510
you would know that this is a downgrade.

29
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:32,830
So before we talk about that phone, let's get into this first.

30
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,530
We're gonna get into the unboxing.

31
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:38,280
Oh, where's the phone?

32
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:42,760
Well, that's because I've done prior testing and now the phone's not here.

33
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:44,400
But everything underneath is still here.

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,730
So let's get into this one first.

35
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:50,200
We got this SIM eject tool, which I won't really be using

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,360
because I already got one from the iFixit toolkit.

37
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:58,030
It is just some simple old quick start guide and that's pretty much it.

38
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:00,400
It's nothing too complex, I guess.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,680
Right, so let's get onto the phone.

40
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:07,930
And we're gonna set up the phone so we can do exactly what we need to do.

41
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:10,530
Enter the Galaxy A06.

42
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,580
Now, I've also done a few things prior.

43
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,810
So I've got myself a new silicone case,

44
00:02:15,816 --> 00:02:17,590
cheapo case that you can find in AliExpress.

45
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,160
And over the front, we got a cheapo tempered glass, also from AliExpress.

46
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,680
Because that's how low we're going,

47
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:28,960
especially with PapaMel complaining about prices left and right.

48
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,530
So you may be wondering to yourself,

49
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:35,410
why don't you just pick up like a cheaper phone that is like of a Chinese brand?

50
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:40,030
That's primarily because I don't really quite trust Chinese companies with their ROMs,

51
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:43,400
especially with advertising and privacy and stuff like that.

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,110
And updates as well.

53
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:47,910
So like the quality of the updates.

54
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:53,410
So in those matters, I've ended up finding myself back to Samsung multiple freaking times,

55
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,830
no matter how much I want to leave them.

56
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:59,060
But regardless, let's boot it up.

57
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,900
Welcome!

58
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,430
Easy setup with another device.

59
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:11,840
Sign in automatically and copy settings and accounts.

60
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,860
Enter...

61
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:17,630
A phone that looks awfully similar.

62
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:21,680
So this right here is a Samsung Galaxy A15,

63
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:24,130
which has pretty much the same case,

64
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,380
the same tempered glass,

65
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:28,460
just on a different model.

66
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:31,610
Do you see how much of a joke this is?

67
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:35,030
PapaMel is willing to go that stupid far

68
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:38,710
to pick up a phone downgrade of this caliber.

69
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:42,260
So this phone is going to be MamaMel's phone eventually.

70
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,130
And that phone's going to be Papa Mel's.

71
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,010
Wow.

72
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,330
What a crazy world I'm living in today.

73
00:03:47,333 --> 00:04:00,030
(Ye olde usual setup...)

74
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,860
Dear Lord, this phone is hitching a lot.

75
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:12,730
Look at the sheer speed of this.

76
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:15,310
Yeah, um, barely moving at all.

77
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:17,380
Oh, God.

78
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:22,830
Yeah, because of this hitching, I'm gonna give it some time to chill and

79
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:26,180
wait for it to finish transferring.

80
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:35,480
Full "casual" cover for members only. (Due to how trash
I think my singing is) OG BGM: Vanfan & Rainych Ran

81
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,410

00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,600
Zutto soba ni ite
(Keep with me in the moment)

83
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,780
Aizu wo shitatte [mo]
(I'd let you had I known It)

84
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:43,960
Iwanai no?
(Why don't you say so?)

85
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,250
(Quack)
After a session...

86
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,350
So it's been a few minutes has passed.

87
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,880
And as you can see, I'm still struggling to transfer

88
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:57,890
chat backups from WeChat manually, as they instructed to.

89
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,810
And, um, well, as you can see at the time,
(06:58H JST)

90
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:06,330
it's not exactly the time that I usually record in.

91
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:13,100
So, yeah, um, and PapaMel is probably gonna be awake anytime soon.

92
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,280
So I better get this done ASAP.

93
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:22,210
So I'm gonna put the camera down and actually get to real work.

94
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:26,430
But yeah, with that said, thank you so much for watching.

95
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:30,140
Thank you so much for chilling with me and watching me go through this

96
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:33,480
crazy little process just for funs and giggles.

97
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:36,860
And I don't know, PapaMel doing a shitty downgrade.

98
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:39,330
But yeah, I'm just gonna leave it at that.

99
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,310
Hopefully it gets done ASAP.

100
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:43,210
I need to catch some sleep.

101
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:43,980
But with that said.

102
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:45,300
OtsuMelo Deshita.

103
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,980
It's 7am JST and I am feeling really fucking eepy right now.

104
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,810
Have a good night, y'all.

105
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:55,980

It's so bad.
