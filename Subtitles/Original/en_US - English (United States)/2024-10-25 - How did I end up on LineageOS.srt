1
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:12,150
Why won't you go away?

2
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:14,130
Fuck!

3
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:18,350
It's 3:36 in Japanese time as of the time of filming

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,890
and I'm making a very stupid video

5
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:22,510
about Android phones again.

6
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:23,600
So, Kon-Melo!

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,300
It's your Tech Wizardess girl, MeloriTensei once again!

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,760
We're back on talking about Android once again.

9
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:34,250
If the few times has not taught me about what my channel actually wanted

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,510
or the analytics wants, it's the countless numbers of times

11
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:40,330
that people actually came for Android videos.

12
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:45,560
So here I am talking about Android once again, or once in a long time.

13
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:48,280
So let's start with something as simple as telling a story.

14
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:51,360
So let's make this video a story time telling video.

15
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:55,360
So it started out with me wanting to try out something very, very different

16
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:56,700
with this Android phone.

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:03,630
So as you may know, having a barely maintained ROM is not exactly ideal.

18
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:07,710
The update frequency for crDroid and PixelOS,
(Current crDroid for d2s - 10.6 | Latest - crDroid 10.9)

19
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:08,880
I'm sorry Fellipe,

20
00:01:08,883 --> 00:01:13,010
was a little longer than I was comfortable with.
(At the time of planning [which was before the Sept Reelase], I got uncomfortable with some of the minor bugs that bothered me through the day)

21
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:16,280
But with due great respects,

22
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:19,530
it's a really, really hard device to take care of.

23
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:22,010
Not to mention all the free times that they have sacrificed

24
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:23,540
for all of us to enjoy.

25
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,930
However, I still like to have my own choices regardless.

26
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,130
I don't like to be locked down to something.

27
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:31,410
So I thought to myself,

28
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,650
"let's try it and explore something really, really out there."

29
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,860
So someone on my Discord server suggested to try out GSIs,

30
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:42,760
which if you don't know what GSIs are, are Android Generic System Images,

31
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:48,080
which are meant to be easier for people to install different kinds of ROM

32
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:52,360
and different kinds of Androids, which are basically just system images.

33
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:55,310
So like kernel not included, everything not included.

34
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:56,880
They have separated everything.

35
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:01,530
And the OS that we all know of is known as the system images.

36
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:07,540
So GSIs are basically just generic system images meant for all devices

37
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,780
that were supported under this Google initiative called Project Treble.

38
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:16,760
The main goal of Project Treble was to make driver updates and driver implementations

39
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:20,880
a whole lot painless for pretty much every Android manufacturer.

40
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:24,710
So to make things more universal to some extent.

41
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:29,430
Think of it like Microsoft's WHQL drivers that we currently enjoy on Windows,

42
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,260
except more on the manufacturer side.

43
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:33,710
So I thought to myself,

44
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:36,680
let's try it out considering this phone has been released

45
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:42,330
well after Project Treble, which means in theory, it is technically Treble compatible.

46
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:47,000
Unfortunately, I've went through a series of hurdles that included with

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,750
the chaos that it came with.

48
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,530
And that chaos is the recovery and the bootloader built into this phone.
(This is not Fastboot. This is Odin Mode. But still, you get the idea...)

49
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:58,660
So there wasn't much documentation that could help me out.

50
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,160
So unfortunately, I went with a very terrible path,

51
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:05,880
particularly with TWRP or Team Win Recovery Project.

52
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:11,210
And let's just say, long story short, it did not really go well at all for me.

53
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:15,480
So I've spent pretty much about a week and a half now by then.

54
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:19,030
And I thought to myself, okay, I give in, I give up.

55
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,680
If I want to try out Treble, I like to find a device that is

56
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:25,590
a whole lot simpler when it comes to recoveries

57
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,780
and does not have proprietary recoveries that screws me over

58
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:31,380
every single time.

59
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:33,910
This is a hell of a phone to deal with.

60
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,960
This, if you don't know, for those uninitiated

61
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,440
or haven't been watching my videos in the past,

62
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:43,330
this is a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus Exynos Edition.

63
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,460
And I'm sure the moment you hear Exynos Edition by the wording,

64
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:48,090
you will realize that, ah,

65
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:53,880
this is something Samsung proprietary this, proprietary that.

66
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:54,610
Yup.

67
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:57,660
Why do you think so many Android ROMs left this phone?

68
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:01,280
The only specialized ROM that I know that is standing right now

69
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:07,280
is currently Fellipe's Pixel OS or its upstream, which is LineageOS.

70
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:12,860
So LineageOS is supposed to be a pretty, pretty darn clean AOSP.

71
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,800
So it's kind of like AOSP,

72
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,030
kind of like how you would supposed to experience with GSIs,

73
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:20,380
but made for device specifics.

74
00:04:20,383 --> 00:04:25,210
So like traditional custom ROMs, but feels like GSIs to some extent,

75
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:27,260
but like a clean AOSP.

76
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,480
So I went with it.

77
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:31,110
And as I was going through the instructions of installing it,

78
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:33,730
I reached at a point where it says GApps.

79
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:38,430
And the instructions from LineageOS suggested me to go through MindTheGApps.

80
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:41,630
I don't use that much Google applications.

81
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:46,480
So I thought to myself, let's take a detour because I don't know if this is possible.

82
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:49,560
So I have not done my prior research, but I kind of went, you know what?

83
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,230
I'm already risking so much for this phone anyway,

84
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:55,710
so might as well just slap everything that's in there.

85
00:04:55,716 --> 00:05:03,560
So I went with a different GApps called NikGapps, and I went for the Core package.

86
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:04,930
Yes, literally core,

87
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:10,310
so core that it only has packages necessary to run the Google Play Store.

88
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:13,330
Whatever I need, like say Google Play Games for games

89
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:18,130
like Blue Archive, Honkai Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Genshin Impact,

90
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:21,010
Zenless Zone Zero, I'll install that later.

91
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:25,500
What I don't like and I'm not comfortable with is the amount of Google bloat

92
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,910
in what MindTheGApps has in its packages.

93
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:34,510
Not to mention there's not really much choice you can do if you're side loading with,

94
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:37,500
I don't know, say, TWRP or something that does not

95
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,410
give you an option command line or something.

96
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:45,110
I don't know if MindTheGApps has an option to begin with, but I just thought to myself,

97
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:48,430
y'know, I've already wasted like a week and a half doing this.

98
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:52,510
I just want a functional Android phone that lets me daily drive all the way.

99
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:55,710
Just let me deal with GSIs on a different phone.

100
00:05:55,716 --> 00:06:01,730
So I went with NikGapps Core and by golly, after that realization,

101
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:06,000
the realization that Google could take so much in the background

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,860
that this phone actually feels like it's breathing new life to it.

103
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,760
Look at how smooth the scroll is.

104
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:13,680
Let me just get into app switchers.

105
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:15,610
Look at it.

106
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:18,060
Fuck me, this is crazy.

107
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,530
Like, I don't know what to tell you.

108
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,810
Say what if I'm not a big fan of using the YouTube app?

109
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,680
What if I just want to use YouTube on a browser?

110
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:27,260
(Forgot to point out that I have UBlock Origin with maxed out filters too)

111
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:30,530
God damn it, it's super goddamn smooth.

112
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:34,960
I don't think I've ever experienced the smoothness I have experienced

113
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:37,530
prior to the multiple ROMs I have gone through.

114
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,560
So that day, it dawned on me.

115
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,910
So what if all the ROMs I've experienced prior,

116
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,880
the lag I've experienced, the lag I've endured,

117
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:49,560
all the hell I've been through with all the magisk, rooting,

118
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:53,810
modules that I've added and removed, testing left and right,

119
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:55,780
all this were all pointless

120
00:06:55,783 --> 00:07:01,230
because the evil villain this whole time has been Google all along.

121
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:05,160
This has hit me like a lightning strike.

122
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,300
I did not for a single second thought

123
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,760
that Google could be a culprit behind this until this.

124
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,810
So this time around, if you're wondering what kind of things I've done

125
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:19,940
to my current Android OS, which is LineageOS,

126
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:24,810
what I've done is I've used a pretty nifty launcher called Lawnchair,

127
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:26,640
which is basically kind of like Pixel Launcher,

128
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:32,110
but with a few more additional stuff like icons and a choice of using icon packs

129
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:37,680
and some customizations to the search and a few little tiny tweak peeks I guess.

130
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:40,160
It's kind of nifty so I kind of recommend you check out

131
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,180
on the Google Play Store or on the GitHub.

132
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:44,860
But this is pretty much it.

133
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:49,860
I just used Lawnchair's LawnIcons and just Lawnchair as a launcher

134
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:52,780
and I got Gigi Murin as my wallpaper this time

135
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:56,210
because Gi-Murin, she's so adorable.

136
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:57,060
Headpat, headpat.

137
00:07:57,066 --> 00:08:02,710
Anyways, as for what kind of Magisk modules I've installed, well, not really much.

138
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:06,230
Personally, I wouldn't be rooting if it weren't for having a purpose.

139
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:13,210
So because I'm using LineageOS, LineageOS actively discourages circumventing measures

140
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:17,210
such as Google Play Integrity and SafetyNet,

141
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:22,880
so the only way to get around it is to take care of this in our own hands.

142
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:27,480
So what I pretty much did was more or less the usual thing you would expect

143
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:29,580
out of a typical Magisk user.

144
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:35,610
So I'm using the stock Magisk 28, followed by Play Integrity Fix, Zygisk,

145
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,140
I'm only using sui for convenience sake

146
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:41,980
because there are a few sui applications like Obtanium

147
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,080
that could help me install things so I don't have to press the install button,

148
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,710
you know, that's just one step extra things, you know,

149
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:49,360
and followed by Zygisk Detach

150
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:52,730
because I really don't like to update certain apps on the Play Store.

151
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,210
But at the same time, you always have that stupid itch

152
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:57,710
to press the refresh update button,

153
00:08:57,716 --> 00:09:00,850
but you can't because you have one app that is not updated

154
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,260
while you have 19 more after you refresh.

155
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:05,280
But that's pretty much it.

156
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:09,260
That's really the basic simple gist of what I've done to my LineageOS.

157
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:11,110
It's really that simple.

158
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:12,630
There's nothing extra to it.

159
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,060
Like what is there?

160
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:14,510
That's it.

161
00:09:14,516 --> 00:09:18,260
I could promote this video sponsor, SD Maid from my great old friend Darken.

162
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,310
In fact, I'm not even going to put the insert video

163
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:22,730
that I usually do with sponsors for SD Maid.

164
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:24,380
I'm just going to do it right now here.

165
00:09:24,383 --> 00:09:25,480
Search.

166
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:30,250
So since I have root access, it's going to dig up even deeper than it should.

167
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:36,200
And then it's going to dig up all my previous apps, even from my previous installations,

168
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,130
I suppose, because look at this, com.Samsung.Android...

169
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:40,790
What in the fuck?

170
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,910
Like guys, I genuinely swear I did not set up for this.

171
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,610
I just legit completely forgot to wipe it out.

172
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:49,480
After I've installed LineageOS.

173
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:50,980
And we're going to have a little chill

174
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:53,760
while we talk about what's great about SD Maid SE.

175
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:57,680
SD Maid SE is currently made by an indie developer named Darken.

176
00:09:57,683 --> 00:10:02,930
And I got to be honest, although he's not some big corporations like CCleaner,

177
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:09,030
like by Piriform or AVG, which pretty much borrows codes from Piriform anyways,
(*At least that's what I remembered years ago. Probably not a thing anymore.)

178
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,480
or any other cleaner.

179
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:16,110
Darken, my man, is kind of an honest man when it comes to creating an honest software.

180
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,030
So do check him out on GitHub.

181
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:22,460
If you have any issues, do reach out to him by Issues, send him some logs,

182
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:26,930
whatever he needs because without communications, you can't get fixes done anyways.

183
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:29,500
Also if you feel like sending some short reports,

184
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,560
like small reports that are not worth an issue ticket,

185
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:33,280
feel free to check out his Discord as well.

186
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:36,010
And we're going to get into cleaning this right now.

187
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:40,130
So while we wait, on top of what these three modules that I've been using,

188
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:44,230
there are also Deduplicator, which is kind of like, if you remember on the PC side,

189
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:48,460
would be more to be called DupeGuru, which is kind of a nifty software.

190
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:50,060
I got to be honest, DupeGuru is kind of cool.

191
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,080
So Deduplicator is kind of like that, but on Android.

192
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,390
And then we got AppControl,

193
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,250
which you can control the apps like enabling, disabling them

194
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,260
stuff at mass or uninstalling stuff as my at mass,

195
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,450
which is what I kind of like doing a lot.

196
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,060
In fact, you might've seen maybe a past video of me doing that,

197
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,730
but you can mass uninstall stuff using AppControl,

198
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:13,030
or you just want to do something with it.

199
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:16,860
I'm not really too sure because I'm not particularly a frequent user of AppControl,

200
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:19,610
but I still think it's kind of a cool idea.

201
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:21,710
If you feel like, if you feel like suggesting more features,

202
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:24,460
please send a feature request on GitHub as well.

203
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:25,980
And then we got Storage Analyzer.

204
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:29,350
It's I remember vaguely that there's a program on Windows

205
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,760
that everyone's using similar to that.

206
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:32,810
It's pretty much similar to that.
(My memory sucks, it's called WinDirStat)

207
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:36,530
Scheduler, as the name suggests, schedules the cleaning process.

208
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:39,460
If you have root, you'll be cleaning this way more thoroughly.

209
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:43,760
However, if you don't have root, you may need to rely on Accessibility Service,

210
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:46,850
but that requires your screen to be on pretty much all the time.

211
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,260
So if my personal advice is turn off,

212
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:52,210
turn off AppCleaner when you're using the Scheduler

213
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:54,830
and just clean the apps at your own accord.

214
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,260
All right.

215
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:58,560
With the sponsor out of the way, what else do I have on my phone?

216
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:02,830
Pretty much Obtanium just for apps that I kind of want to install through GitHub,

217
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,640
but I don't want to go through the update process

218
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:07,560
by manually going to the page and stuff.

219
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:09,360
Obtanium is kind of helpful in that.

220
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:11,230
So great props, Obtanium.

221
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:14,430
Though in theory you could just get around with using F-Droid,

222
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,830
but some apps just are not available in F-Droid.

223
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,410
So Obtanium was like a good alternative for me.

224
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,330
And that's pretty much it.

225
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:27,280
Honestly, I don't think there's anything on my apps list that jumps out to you.

226
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:33,110
Aside from the fact that I use K9-Mail while also using Thunderbird.

227
00:12:33,116 --> 00:12:38,580
Sorry, I'm just kind of enthusiastic with Thunderbird stuff.

228
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,010
It's been a lifesaver for me,

229
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:44,180
especially for someone who has a lot of personal emails to take care of.

230
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:45,730
And honestly, that's pretty much it.

231
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:52,910
Aside from SlimeVR sitting there for unknown reasons that I will not elaborate on.

232
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,600
We'll get to that eventually.

233
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,830
But yeah, pretty much it.

234
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,200
Aside from just grinding Blue Archive, I guess.

235
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,010
Like there really isn't much for me to do.

236
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:06,130
I just use this phone as my secondary grinder for Blue Archive, I guess.

237
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:10,630
Oh, speaking of Blue Archive, feel free to check out the upcoming stream tomorrow.

238
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:15,060
That is tomorrow as in the day after the publishing of this video.

239
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:16,860
I'm going to be having another Blue Archive stream.

240
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:18,610
We're going to be checking out something awesome here.

241
00:13:18,616 --> 00:13:21,640
So feel free to check me out there on the live tab.

242
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:26,540
But yeah, on a different note, I've also completely wiped out my X account.

243
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:29,450
So no more Twitter anymore because Twitter is…

244
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,310
Twitter has become a hellhole.

245
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:32,310
There, I said it.

246
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:37,290
So as of today, I've moved to Bluesky for my small and short posts

247
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:40,160
that I don't feel like posting on YouTube community posts.

248
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:44,060
There are still posts that I still make on YouTube community posts and plenty, if anything,

249
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:47,960
because YouTube community posts and Discord will still remain my main

250
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:50,100
primary communications channel.

251
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,710
Whereas Bluesky is going to become my kind of like

252
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:55,610
a semi-background casual communications, I guess.

253
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:58,380
But I still prefer you reaching out to me on Discord

254
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:00,950
or on the community posts because I'm more active there.

255
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,140
But with that said, I hope you all keep up with me

256
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,130
and I'm still making some changes to my channel.

257
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:11,710
So more bangers of content might be still in the works

258
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:15,230
and I'm not sure what's bangers to you anyways, but you be the judge.

259
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:17,350
With that said, thank you all so much for watching

260
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,410
and be sure to subscribe, press the notification bell,

261
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,710
and I don't know, maybe let me know in the comments

262
00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:24,760
what other video do you want me to make?

263
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:28,210
Be it Android kind of video, gaming video, what else do you want?

264
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:31,510
Please let me know, I genuinely need some content.

265
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:33,530
But with that said, done with story times,

266
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:37,580
I'm gonna wrap up my recording and relax for another week I suppose.

267
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,560
Nah, just joking, I'll be making more videos, fuck it.

268
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,460
And I'll see you guys next time.

269
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:43,860
OtsuMelo deshita.

270
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,760
Peace!

271
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,860
