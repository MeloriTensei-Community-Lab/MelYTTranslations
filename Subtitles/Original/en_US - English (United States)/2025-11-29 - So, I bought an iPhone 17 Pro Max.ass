Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.53,0:04:06.87,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,The fact that these are all on the base iPhones,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.87,0:04:10.87,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,kind of reducing reasons to get a Pro for an average person.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.87,0:04:12.45,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Well, I'm no average person.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.45,0:04:15.22,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I only get a new phone whenever a phone gets discontinued

Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.07,0:04:20.08,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,This is an exception,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.08,0:04:22.07,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,especially when all the past iPhone upgrades
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.07,0:04:23.75,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,are minuscule increments
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.75,0:04:26.73,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and that you have vapor chamber cooling on the pro phones,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.73,0:04:29.12,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,which supposedly spreads the heat more evenly,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.12,0:04:31.23,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,allowing for longer sustained loads.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.23,0:04:32.92,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I suppose that's how hot it gets.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.92,0:04:34.72,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,We've reached that point, guys.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.72,0:04:36.57,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Aside from the vapor chamber,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.57,0:04:38.53,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,there's 12 gigs of RAM instead of eight.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.53,0:04:41.13,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,There's ProRes RAW, meaning I can adjust the exposure in post
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.13,0:04:42.70,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,whenever I screw up something.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.70,0:04:44.07,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,And...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.07,0:04:45.90,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,we don't talk about the camera button.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.90,0:04:48.28,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Three cameras, so there's dedicated lens for each,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.28,0:04:51.32,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,but allegedly it doesn't improve from the last generation.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.32,0:04:53.68,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,But for someone like me who came from the 12 Pro Max,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.68,0:04:54.97,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,there should be a jump of quality
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.97,0:04:57.10,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,from 12 megapixel across the board
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.10,0:04:59.07,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,to 48, also across the board.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.07,0:05:02.00,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Obvious things out of the way, let's get hands on with the phone.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.00,0:05:05.38,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,One thing I did want to find out is the charging part of the phone.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.38,0:05:08.55,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,In the keynote, they said it can charge to 50%
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.55,0:05:11.23,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,in 20 minutes with a 40 watt charger.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.23,0:05:12.35,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,(slams desk)
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.35,0:05:13.62,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Let's find that out.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.62,0:05:17.85,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Right, so the reason why I'm bringing in this Baseus power bank
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.85,0:05:20.40,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,is because it has a wattage indicator.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.40,0:05:22.75,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,While it is not exactly professional,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.75,0:05:27.77,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,however, it is quite enough to show me basic information
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.77,0:05:29.85,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,to see how much it charges, I guess.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.85,0:05:33.20,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So let's have a look how much it charges.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.95,0:05:42.85,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Well, unfortunately, I can't find out how much it charges,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.85,0:05:47.75,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,unfortunately, primarily because I got 74% battery,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.75,0:05:50.00,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,so it's currently trickle charging,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.00,0:05:53.62,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,but at least we can see that it trickles at 17 watts, probably
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.62,0:05:57.60,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,16, 15, it's going back and forth, I suppose.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.60,0:06:01.77,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,However, to charge this phone at its optimal speed of 40 watts,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.77,0:06:03.52,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Parrotting a Chinese equivalent of LTT
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.52,0:06:06.85,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,but filmography focused tech tuber, Mediastorm,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.85,0:06:08.43,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,check their coverage out too,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.43,0:06:12.35,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,{\an8}you need specifically a USB PD 3.2 charger
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.87,0:06:12.35,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,{\k55\2aFF}(USB {\k54}PD {\k70}3.2 {\k69}Charger)
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.35,0:06:14.10,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,which has two key features,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.10,0:06:17.00,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,{\an8}which are SPR, standard power range,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.82,0:06:17.00,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,SPR = Standard Power Range\N(Allows power up to 100w, but this iPhone can only do 40w)
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.20,0:06:19.75,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,AVS = Adjustable Voltage Supply*\N(Allows scaling voltages per small steps)\N*For some reason, it's either "Supply" or "Source"
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.00,0:06:19.88,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,{\an8}and AVS, adjustable voltage source.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.88,0:06:23.67,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,This is a hyper new standard and it's way ahead of its time,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.67,0:06:26.77,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,so it'll be some long periods of time before it becomes a norm,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.77,0:06:30.45,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,unless you're willing to shell out $39 for Apple's own charger.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.45,0:06:34.32,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Erhhh...Which... personal opinion, I would not,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.32,0:06:37.48,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,{\an8}because in Mediastorm's own test, even without AVS,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.48,0:06:40.33,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,{\an8}you'd still be able to reach almost similar charging speeds,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.97,0:06:42.98,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,(Seriously, check them out! English subtitles available)
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.33,0:06:43.20,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,{\an8}within the 20 minutes of charging that they have done.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.20,0:06:45.77,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Now let's get the power bank out of the way.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.77,0:06:47.85,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I'm going to take a second to address people's complaints
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.85,0:06:49.18,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,as they watched the intro.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.18,0:06:51.52,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Why is there a hole in the screen protector?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.52,0:06:55.45,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,There's possibly only one reason why that might be the case.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.45,0:06:57.30,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,That's because I have not actually applied
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.30,0:06:59.45,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,the screen protector prior to this,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.45,0:07:02.02,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and I've already begun using the phone.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.02,0:07:04.25,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So, there's a high chance that
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.25,0:07:06.67,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I might have not cleaned the screen properly.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.67,0:07:09.20,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So, I'm going to try to clean the screen again
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.20,0:07:12.38,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and reinstall the screen protector properly.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.38,0:07:14.30,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Hopefully there's an update video.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.72,0:07:28.33,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,And secondly, why a silicone case and a screen protector?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.33,0:07:30.13,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Well, as a full-blown Asian,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.13,0:07:33.55,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I have the mindset to ensure the phone's resale value
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.55,0:07:35.02,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,is as high as possible,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.02,0:07:37.55,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,even when I have zero intentions of selling the phone.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.55,0:07:39.12,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I don't think that's the right way to put it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.12,0:07:40.48,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I guess you could say...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.48,0:07:42.83,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I handle it like an overprotective person
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.83,0:07:45.70,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and prefer the phone to be as mint as possible,

Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.73,0:08:50.75,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and I find the results kind of confusing to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.75,0:08:53.47,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,It's probably because the brand new Apple N1 chip

Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.02,0:09:13.97,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,However, it's a little bit slower on the 17 Pro Max.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.97,0:09:16.08,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,There may be some other factor at play,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.08,0:09:18.87,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,probably because of my router's weird beamforming,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.87,0:09:20.03,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,or something else.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.10,0:09:31.23,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,However, I did feel, probably it's a placebo effect,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.23,0:09:33.90,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,that I got better WiFi reception signal
