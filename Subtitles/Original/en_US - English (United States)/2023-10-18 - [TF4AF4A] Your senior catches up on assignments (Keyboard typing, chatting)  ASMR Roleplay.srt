1
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:15,960
Man, that's a lot of assignments to work on.

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,630
Oh, well hello.

3
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,830
Didn't see you there.

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,800
How are you doing?

5
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:28,060
Glad to hear.

6
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:32,730
So, what brings you here?

7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,930
Feeling a little bored?

8
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:43,530
Wanted to hear a little bit of what I'm working on?

9
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:48,860
Well, you see, I've been really busy on assignments these days,

10
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:53,730
so there isn't really much about me.

11
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,160
Do you wanna sit around and watch me type?

12
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:02,660
Great.

13
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,060
Glad to hear.

14
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,360
Good.

15
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:15,400
Good little junior.

16
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:20,064
You sure you wanna stick around?

17
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:27,090
I mean, all I'm doing is just mostly typing out manuscripts and stuff.

18
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,400
Alright.

19
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,360
Suit yourself.

20
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:45,090
Right, let's see.

21
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:47,330
This file.

22
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,930
Hmm.

23
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:56,730
That particular folder.

24
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,360
Oh, dang it.

25
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:07,360
Need to type my freaking password again.

26
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:18,930
Oh fuck.

27
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:22,190
My finger slipped.

28
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,960
Sorry about that.

29
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:36,300
I shouldn't be swearing, considering I'm your senior.

30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,300
Ah, there we go.

31
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,590
Finally got it.

32
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,360
Right, let's see.

33
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,860
This folder.

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,430
Hmm.

35
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,590
Do you wanna have a look?

36
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,530
What's that?

37
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:11,690
Don't like being touched around your ears?

38
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,860
Hmm.

39
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,660
Here, let me tease you a little.

40
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:25,300
Okay, for real.

41
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,030
Here, have a look.

42
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,660
Have a look at the document.

43
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,160
Really?

44
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,126
Cool.

45
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:46,590
Alright, time to get back to focusing.

46
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:50,360
It's gonna get really distracting if I keep talking.

47
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:52,130
Here we go.

48
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,830
Oh, here we go.

49
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:17,500
You know, I'm not often a multitasker.

50
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:27,260
Because sometimes I get really distracted when I'm typing while I'm talking.

51
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:33,460
But I can sometimes manage it a little.

52
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,030
What's that?

53
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,690
Oh, how long will it take?

54
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,760
I'm...

55
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,160
not really too sure.

56
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,100
This is a crazy long document.

57
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:58,800
I mean, considering that this is a pretty big major.

58
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:05,930
So, I mean, it's not the final year thing, you know.

59
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:09,230
But it is still pretty big, you know.

60
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,600
That kind of document.

61
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,160
How did I do last time?

62
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,030
Well umm,

63
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:28,760
average, I guess.

64
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:31,060
I mean,

65
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:38,330
I'm just able to get away with certain scores, I guess.

66
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,687
Oh, speaking of average scores.

67
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:53,160
I don't think I should be teaching you that as a senior,

68
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:57,800
but I got a really interesting way to...

69
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:02,930
to score well in exams with barely any studying.

70
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:11,347
So if you try to take in the piece of information and try to make it a little…

71
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,190
How do I say this?

72
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,917
Interesting in your way?

73
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:23,030
Somehow you end up becoming really, really curious.

74
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:28,030
And it makes you want to read up a little more.

75
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:36,560
Yeah, that's kind of my trick to how I'm able to balance between work and play.

76
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:42,600
I mean, I'm sure you've seen me playing at the arcade a couple of times

77
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,773
and going on a couple of parties with some friends.

78
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,230
I'm not just moping around all the time, you know.

79
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:58,260
I'm just taking studies a little smarter because, you know,

80
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:06,460
one might struggle to pass an examination if they get really, really, really stressed out.

81
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:17,460
I've heard from a good number of people when they say life is a race.

82
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:25,160
I could agree to some extent, but not everything is a race, don't you think?

83
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:32,190
Sometimes you just gotta slow it down a little.

84
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:40,060
Take a step back, do it at your pace, and you'll notice what you're missing.

85
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:44,960
Don't you think?

86
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,260
Great.

87
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:51,177
Good, Junior.

88
00:07:51,177 --> 00:07:54,160
*pat pat pat pat pat pat*

89
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,340
I gotta get back to typing.

90
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,560
Silly me.

91
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:02,430
Here we go.

92
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,000
Hmm, this is an interesting document.

93
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,290
How should I put it?

94
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,930
Do you have any idea?

95
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm just kidding.

96
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,460
No, I'm not gonna put so much pressure on you.

97
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:20,830
You're just my junior.

98
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:30,330
I mean, you're not in the same class as me yet, but I'm happy to get to know you sooner.

99
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:36,890
I mean, eventually, I might have to guide you on some certain subjects.

100
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't you think?

101
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:06,330
Oh.

102
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:10,760
Hmm.

103
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:13,560
Something's not a little right with the document right here.

104
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:16,830
Right here.

105
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,030
Hmm.

106
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,790
Yeah.

107
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,730
I'm not particularly good with English either.

108
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,730
I mean…

109
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:37,200
I'm not ESL, as one might say, but…

110
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:38,700
I'm not too sure.

111
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:46,416
It's just that my English knowledge is just slowly falling, slipping away.

112
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,430
I'm not really too sure.

113
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:50,230
Maybe, I don't know if this happens with other people,

114
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:55,530
but it feels like my English knowledge slowly slips away.

115
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:01,430
Maybe it's because I've been learning other languages a little too much.

116
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:04,790
Or maybe I've been thinking on other languages.

117
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,640
Yeah, maybe that might be the case.

118
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,000
I should probably brush up on my English as well.

119
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,630
I'm gonna quickly save it real quick, so I don't lose the document.

120
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:40,030
Some people do tend to lose their document to accidentally closing the program, crashing computers, and stuff like that.

121
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:41,100
Yeah.

122
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,560
I'm not letting that happen.

123
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:47,000
Phew.

124
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,247
What a mouthful.

125
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:53,760
That's like two paragraphs about that, yeah.

126
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:00,560
Hmm?

127
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:02,790
Oh, yeah.

128
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,530
I should be working about like…

129
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:07,460
20 pages of that.

130
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:10,560
Currently I'm on page…

131
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,130
19?

132
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:15,160
Is that 19?

133
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,130
Sorry, I'm having a hard time looking.

134
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,830
I'm having some bad eyesight right now.

135
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,890
Gotta zoom it in.

136
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:25,530
Hmm, yeah.

137
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:26,890
It is 19.

138
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,660
Alright.

139
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,160
I got one more page to go.

140
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,660
Why the limit?

141
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,790
I don't really know.

142
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:40,200
Maybe…

143
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,860
I'm not really too sure.

144
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:45,960
You gotta ask the department for that.

145
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:48,100
The education department.

146
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,930
They said something about like,

147
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:53,960
Oh, you gotta write up to 20 pages of that.

148
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,430
That should be the limit.

149
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:59,660
They didn't say anything about, you know…

150
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,260
They didn't say anything about…

151
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:08,790
Writing how many words onto a 20-page document.

152
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:15,100
So while others have written theirs in font size 12,

153
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:19,790
I've written mine in font size 14.

154
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:24,860
I don't think you should follow my example for that, but…

155
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:27,960
I've been able to get away with that.

156
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:29,760
Because…

157
00:15:29,766 --> 00:15:32,230
It's still a readable document.

158
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:35,390
It's still a very acceptable document.

159
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,960
I got pretty much high schools with that anyways.

160
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:47,530
But seriously, don't follow my example.

161
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:51,360
Someday, the education department may just…

162
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,130
I don't know.

163
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,430
Catch up to my tail.

164
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,330
Oh, oh.

165
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,260
It's been quite a while.

166
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:01,060
You have not drank…

167
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:03,130
You have not drank water.

168
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,390
Would you like to have some?

169
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,600
Oh, you have your own?

170
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,100
It's okay.

171
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,030
Drink up, drink up.

172
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,430
You gotta…

173
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,530
You gotta hydrate.

174
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,930
Excuse me.

175
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:34,890
Pardon me.

176
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:37,430
I drank a little too fast.

177
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:46,630
Hmm.

178
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:50,100
Yeah, I should take it easy.

179
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,530
I mean, I just said it earlier.

180
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,100
Not everything is a race.

181
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:04,923
See?

182
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,660
You're not so bad after all.

183
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,930
Good junior.

184
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:14,360
You have paid attention so far.

185
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,850
So…

186
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,830
I gotta be honest.

187
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,530
You did an amazing job.

188
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:24,290
I'm sure you'll be able to influence someone…

189
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,830
Under your wing as well.

190
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,830
Alright, let's get this document done.

191
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,930
So we can get out of here and…

192
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:35,460
I don't know, chill.

193
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:04,960
How did I type all this?

194
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:07,160
Without reading up on anything?

195
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,460
Oh, silly you.

196
00:18:08,466 --> 00:18:10,830
Haven't you paid attention from earlier?

197
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,000
I did tell you that…

198
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,060
That I digest all my information from…

199
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:18,160
By making it interesting.

200
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,160
That's how I remember all of everything.

201
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:27,060
Because without a curious mind, you can't really get anything in.

202
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:28,630
Because you…

203
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:31,790
Once you feel like you're…

204
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,830
You're being forced to learn a certain thing…

205
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,160
You end up not enjoying it.

206
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,660
Which then…

207
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,590
Also means you're gonna have a hard time remembering it.

208
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,430
So…

209
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,830
I've decided to make it…

210
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,590
Interesting.

211
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:47,460
Even for myself.

212
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:50,830
Even if it seems boring from the outside.

213
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,430
Though,there are times where I do need to look up…

214
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,860
Look up online about…

215
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:06,420
About what I've missed.

216
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,200
But…

217
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,930
But the joy is…

218
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:14,230
In actually understanding what's going on.

219
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,130
Hmm...

220
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,360
Oh…

221
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:47,400
A typo.

222
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:53,590
Same spot, right?

223
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,660
Alright, let's review the whole document.

224
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,760
Let's see…

225
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:01,330
Page 1…

226
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,160
Page 2…

227
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,260
Right, page 3…

228
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:20,530
Page 4…

229
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:26,660
Page 5…

230
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,360
Page 6…

231
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,260
No, no, no, no, no.

232
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,500
That didn't look right.

233
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,560
Let me just fix that real quick.

234
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,030
Let me fix that.

235
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:46,500
That seriously did not look right at all.

236
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,290
Where to start?

237
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,560
Hm, right here.

238
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:14,400
Oh!

239
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,000
Looking good.

240
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Right, page 6 looking good.

241
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,500
Page 7…

242
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:25,860
8…

243
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:31,000
9…

244
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:36,700
10…

245
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,560
11…

246
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:47,660
12…

247
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:51,860
13…

248
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:53,660
four-…

249
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,360
Oh!

250
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:58,400
No, no, no, no, no.

251
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,500
No, I gotta fact check that one real quick.

252
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,530
Mm-mm-mm.

253
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:26,830
No wonder something fell off with that.

254
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:27,760
Okay, I gotta fix that.

255
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:30,060
I gotta fix that.

256
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,760
Right.

257
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:10,500
Hm!

258
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,130
Anyway,

259
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:14,730
Throw this whole paragraph out of the way.

260
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:15,830
Boop!

261
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,290
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

262
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,360
Hehe.

263
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,430
Ah…

264
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:24,530
Okay, yeah, that looks fine.

265
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:25,330
Right.

266
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,700
14's looking clean.

267
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,660
Right.

268
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:32,090
15…

269
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,400
16…

270
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:40,730
17…

271
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:44,590
18…

272
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,930
19…

273
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,574
Hm, that didn't flow right.

274
00:23:58,574 --> 00:24:03,400
Well, I started page 19 anyways, so…

275
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,230
I've worked on this document since like…

276
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:08,330
days ago, so it didn't flow right.

277
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:12,560
Let me just quickly correct that.

278
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:20,030
Maybe I should make a sentence flow from…

279
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:25,290
from like, here, all the way to…

280
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,130
here.

281
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
you think so?

282
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:34,330
Good idea.

283
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,427
Actually, hold on.

284
00:24:36,427 --> 00:24:39,000
Wait, right here.

285
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,430
Doesn't it look a little off?

286
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:46,060
Like, from here to here.

287
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:53,523
Hm.

288
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:54,660
Yeah, you're right.

289
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,290
I should correct that real quick.

290
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,630
How should I type it?

291
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:05,960
Looking by the previous paragraph, it would be…

292
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:08,000
like this.

293
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:25,530
hm.

294
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:27,330
Yeah.

295
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,290
Thank you so much.

296
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:32,060
Thank you so much, lil Junior.

297
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,430
Good.

298
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:41,000
But still, my bad.

299
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,030
I should be the senior here.

300
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:44,330
I shouldn't be asking tips from juniors.

301
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:47,160
But, you know.

302
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:50,330
Why is it so important?

303
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,547
It's just…

304
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:53,760
We're humans after all.

305
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:57,060
We all make mistakes anyways, so…

306
00:25:58,066 --> 00:25:59,790
Right, let's go to it.

307
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:03,000
The whole of 19…

308
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,830
20…

309
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:10,847
Oh shoot, I forgot to do the conclusion.

310
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:13,000
Silly me.

311
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:15,960
Oh no.

312
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:17,900
Okay, we gotta get this up.

313
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,160
Right now.

314
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:23,889
Hm.

315
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:26,360
And… dot!

316
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,413
And save.

317
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:31,560
Don't forget to save.

318
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:34,830
Alright, we gotta get this printed.

319
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:37,303
Wait.

320
00:27:37,303 --> 00:27:38,260
Ah, dang it.

321
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:40,430
We're at the end of this library.

322
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:42,530
God dang it.

323
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:45,560
Ah, I gotta walk so freaking far

324
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:48,460
just to get to the printer.

325
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,960
Fine, I'll get it.

326
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:54,360
Let me just send it to the printing server.

327
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:56,290
Right…

328
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:56,900
now.

329
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,730
Okay.

330
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:01,500
I'll grab the paper.

331
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,900
But first, thank you so much, Junior.

332
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,830
I mean…

333
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:09,330
If you feel free to wait for me outside if you wanna…

334
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,290
I don't know.

335
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:14,830
Grab some food with me before we go home.

336
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,030
Catch you later.

337
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:20,000
See ya.
