00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,560
Kon-Melo~

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,960
Kon-Melo~

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,280
Fuck.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,240
We should probably relocate a lot of this stuff.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,480
It's not getting my face well at all.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:29,960
That's the funniest part.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,360
Kon-Melo~

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,760
Kon-Melo~

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:48,560
Today, what I'm planning to do is 
just record a simple trigger test.

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,520
Trigger test.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:59,480
Trigger test with none other than a 
really old Razer Seiren microphone

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:08,800
that I have repaired just not long ago.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,880
Fuck's sake.

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,040
This table sucks.

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,960
So basically, what the Razer Seiren does is…

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:27,000
It has a stereo mode and an omnidirectional mode.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
However, it's trying to be a Blue Yeti copycat.

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,640
Which honestly, I felt really 
cheated when I didn't know about this

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,720
and I bought it to the Razer price premium

20
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,000
because the Blue Yeti in today's market price

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,840
is half the price of what I 
bought this piece of junk at MSRP.

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,600
You can tell how pretty pissed I was…

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,720
when I learned about the 
existence of the Blue Yeti.

24
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:24,720
However, considering how Razer tried to 
be an absolute copycat of the Blue Yeti…

25
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,720
I basically tore this mic down and I looked into

26
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:38,360
basically the internal components 
of this microphone and I found that…

27
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:46,960
This microphone is more or less 
identical to the Blue Yeti.

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,280
Just with cheaper quality parts 
compared to what the Blue Yeti uses.

29
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,560
It has the same amount of pickups.

30
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,600
It has the same amount of daughterboards, I guess.

31
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,720
I'm not really too sure about that one.

32
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:17,400
And pretty much, internally, it felt nothing 
more than a flat-out Blue Yeti copycat.

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,320
Even down to how Blue positions the pickup.

34
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:32,160
Which is why, when you're listening to the right 
side, it felt less direct than the left side.

35
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:40,640
Because how the right side was being 
picked up is not directly on the side.

36
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,880
Hence why they can't really call 
stereo "binaural", to say the least.

37
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,560
The left side is directly on the left side.

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,920
But the right side has like 
a cross-shaped pattern.

39
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:03,360
That's something you can find 
on a Tascam pickup but worse.

40
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,160
This ASMR trigger test serves to be a sample test

41
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:17,360
for myself and hopefully future 
ASMR enjoyers on this channel.

42
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,120
Should I make more ASMR content?

43
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:29,720
If you've got triggers or roleplay ideas or 
anything that I am within my comfort zone doing…

44
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,240
Please let me know in the description…

45
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,040
I mean, fuck.

46
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,800
Please let me know in the comments below.

47
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,440
I would be happy to give it a shot.

48
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,880
This is the first ever setup 
where I didn't have to complain

49
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:55,960
about absurdly loud laptop noises 
that sound like fucking jet engines.

50
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,280
So, the only thing I can complain about,

51
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,440
if anything, is my air conditioner.

52
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:24,440
So, let's get started with 
a few basic key triggers.

53
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,640
For monitoring, I'm using the Salnotes Zero:2 IEM.

54
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,000
And I store it in this earphone case,

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,520
which is pretty much just 
a cheapo TRN earphone case.

56
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:49,480
Because the moment I bought the 
Salnotes Zero:2, I ran out of money.

57
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,880
Regardless, the Salnotes 
Zero:2 is an amazing piece.

58
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,760
And it's really, really good 
when it comes to budget IEMs.

59
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,200
Special thanks to sonic_idk 
for recommending this to me,

60
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,760
and the fellows in the IEM community on Reddit.

61
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,080
And also crinacle for tuning this piece.

62
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,520
It's amazing stuff.

63
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:29,560
Anyways, let's proceed.

64
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,520
Okay.
I got a pair of barber scissors…

65
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:59,520
in hopes that I eventually learn how 
to trim my hair and style my own hair.

66
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:22,400
In an environment where I don't have 
that many supportive allies in person,

67
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,000
I had to do all this in secret.

68
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,680
Today, the recording time is June 4th.

69
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,280
It's pretty much Pride Month, but…

70
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,920
I don't really do anything 
for Pride Month, to be honest.

71
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:49,040
Aside from just saying, yes, I'm a trans girl

72
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,840
in an unsupportive environment, 
that's pretty much it.

73
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,160
With that said, let's get on with the video.

74
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,680
Sometimes, when things start to rain,

75
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,600
and you feel like you're feeling a 
little bit sleepy in the background,

76
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,720
you thought to yourself:

77
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:22,440
"What do I want to sleep to 
on top of these rain noises?"

78
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:29,760
So I thought to myself, let's go to AliExpress

79
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:48,280
and buy a cheap Kalimba.

80
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,800
Oh, shoot, I missed a note.

81
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,720
I was going to do You Are My 
Sunshine, but I'm tone deaf, sadly.

82
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,080
Sorry, not tone deaf.

83
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,400
Just note illiterate.

84
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,760
So the notes I see on my Kalimba, 
I don't really know what is what.

85
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,600
You know what?

86
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:29,360
Let's try doing this by playing 
Kalimba in a nonsensical way.

87
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,040
No way.

88
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,080
I just did the ending part for 
Can't Help Falling In Love With You.

89
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,040
Holy crap.

90
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:59,320
No fucking way.

91
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:29,320
What the fuck was that?

92
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,440
I wonder what song I should play out of this.

93
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,720
Let me know in the comments below.

94
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,480
I'll try practicing a few songs.

95
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:51,560
And maybe play a few for an ASMR.

96
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,200
To be honest, had I practiced more Kalimba,

97
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,880
it would actually be really therapeutic.

98
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,720
Moving on.

99
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,960
Oh, fuck.

100
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,440
There was plenty of dust in there.

101
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,880
So, I used to major in a university.

102
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:23,720
And they had a certain assignment where 
it needs you to start getting some stuff.

103
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,360
And kind of upsell some stuff for charity.

104
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,760
The profits that we make out 
of the upsells goes to charity.

105
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:41,520
And I happened to contribute to one of 
them by just buying one of their products.

106
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:59,120
And coincidentally, it's none other than just 
some custom printed mug that has Bongo Cat on it.

107
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,840
Pretty sturdy, innit?

108
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,720
Now I'm more or less running out of triggers.

109
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,520
Because this video really is done in a whim.

110
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,600
In hopes that I can make videos faster.

111
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:23,160
So I got extra time to save for a bigger project.

112
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,960
I hope you look forward to those bigger projects.

113
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:31,800
Because regardless, this video 
is still part of an experiment.

114
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,200
for what type of content actually suits me.

115
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,120
But if you do enjoy it, please do 
let me know in the comments below.

116
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:46,840
Regardless, I'm hoping to make probably 
some no-talking triggers eventually.

117
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:55,960
But I need enough sets of triggers to have 
an excuse to record a no-talking session.

118
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,520
So if you got a suggestion, please 
let me know in the comments below.

119
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,200
It would be greatly appreciated.

120
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,400
If you remember the ASMR that I had,

121
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:16,080
something about "Senpai catches 
up with assignments with you".

122
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,280
There's a point in time where I 
actually did a small little headpat.

123
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,760
What I did is basically I wrapped 
this microphone with shower cap.

124
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,360
A fabric shower cap.

125
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,560
Because this mic, unlike the Blue Yeti,

126
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,640
if you touch the Blue Yeti on its 
own, it may sound very therapeutic.

127
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,280
The problem of the Razer 
Seiren is if you touch it,

128
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,600
it feels like scratchy 
plastic and metallic noises.

129
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,000
Metallic on the body, plastic on the wind guard.

130
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,400
So if I were to replicate 
whatever the Blue Yeti is doing,

131
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:06,040
I needed that shower cap to 
simulate that I put foam on it.

132
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,080
And along with it, I need to make sure 
that it doesn't cling onto my hands

133
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:22,320
because it might make a really awful sound 
if it clings onto bits of my peeled-off skin.

134
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,920
So I use a different kind of cloth and 
just rub against each other like this.

135
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:50,120
So now that you know how left and right 
sounds like, here's the proper headpat.

136
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,480
Get the picture?

137
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,160
Good.

138
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,840
Now how about some mouth sounds?

139
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:07,960
I know on YouTube, the TOS for it may 
be a little bit on the funny side.

140
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,920
So if you like something 
along the lines of licking,

141
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:20,160
I hope I can do that for you somewhere 
else on a different platform.

142
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,760
Probably on a certain popular 
audio platform or something.

143
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,640
But if you do want that 
anyway, please let me know.

144
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,920
I'm actually looking forward to this.

145
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,280
I'll do what's allowed for the time being.

146
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,480
Mouth clicking sounds or whatever they call it.

147
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,080
Onomatopoeia, I guess I forgot 
how to pronounce it actually.

148
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,840
Hilariously I know how to read it,

149
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,720
but I don't know how to 
pronounce it or remember it.

150
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:09,920
I wonder what creates a lot of clicking 
sounds like the word "click" itself.

151
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,360
Click, click, click, click, click.

152
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,640
Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock.

153
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:28,720
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

154
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:58,640
Maybe a little bit of blowing.

155
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:36,160
Peter Piper picked a pepper...

156
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:43,040
A couple of tongue twisters might work.

157
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,130
She sells seashells on the seashore.

158
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:53,939
バス、爆発。
(Bus, explosions.)

159
00:20:53,939 --> 00:21:00,432
Wait... is that correct? Sorry.

160
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:05,360
Y'know what? I'll search for it next time.

161
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,000
And finally, we're gonna momentarily close it off

162
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,135
with a simple roast to Razer

163
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:23,680
For barely innovating completely 
brand new products around that time.

164
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,520
At the time of the creation 
of the OG Razer Seiren,

165
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,400
the reason why you have not seen this Razer Seiren

166
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,760
that you're seeing on screen right 
now on their product page is because

167
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:50,240
they were really embarrassed by the 
criticism that was given to them

168
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:58,800
from the quality to the insane price premium 
that they charge on this very product.

169
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:05,840
So they basically erased this product 
from the face of their own website.

170
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:12,320
The only last place you get to see 
this product is in their support page.

171
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,920
There is only one page for it.

172
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:28,520
And pretty much almost around that time, 
I bought their Razer Blackwidow Chroma V2.

173
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:36,960
And as much as I enjoyed it around that time...

174
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:46,920
Once I discovered the world of custom 
keyboards, I've never looked back.

175
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:56,180
However, I do have a piece of memorial 
for the dark emo Razer times that I had.

176
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:59,289
this...  

177
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:17,280
is the Razer Green Switch keychain that 
you get on some of the Razer keyboards.

178
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:25,680
And I pretty much held on to this keychain until…

179
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,440
well, today.

180
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,600
Can you hear the ringing in the springs?

181
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:58,440
It's insane.

182
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,880
It honestly sounded like 
the galvanized square steel.

183
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,120
I don't know.

184
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,280
I genuinely don't know what 
galvanized square steel actually is.

185
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,600
I just know that it sounds horrendous.

186
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
So that's it.

187
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,360
I hope you enjoyed this ASMR trigger test.

188
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,960
If you do enjoy more of this, or you want 
more kinds of different kinds of ASMR,

189
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:44,880
maybe roleplay or something like that, 
please let me know in the comments below,

190
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,600
what do you want to hear out of this microphone?

191
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:58,320
Possibly a test, or a roleplay, or a 
livestream, or anything of the sort.

192
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm open to suggestions.

193
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,160
Because I really do enjoy 
ASMR as a listener myself.

194
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:13,400
And I feel like I deeply owe to the ASMR community

195
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:21,840
for consuming a criminal amount 
of ASMR in my entire lifetime.

196
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,400
In fact, just after recording this,

197
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:37,040
I'm just gonna slap my head on the 
pillow and tune in to some ASMR.

198
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,800
Have a good night.
