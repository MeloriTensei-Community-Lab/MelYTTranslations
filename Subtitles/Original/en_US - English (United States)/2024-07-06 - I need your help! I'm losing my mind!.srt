1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,580
Well would you look at that!

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,000
Another case of being unlucky as MeloriTensei.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,380
KonMelo, today I'm going to be recording this completely unedited.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,480
Because I'm going to talk about whatever happened the day before this video upload I guess.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,880
So what happened was that I was streaming Zenless Zone Zero for the launch day stream.

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,020
So I was really really excited for what comes out for that game.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,120
However, I was completely beset by sudden shutdowns that were just…

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,640
It just goes black, everything goes black, USB goes out, everything goes out.

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,480
Basically the whole motherboard goes out.

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,880
But weirdly enough, the power LED is still on.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,500
It got me real curious.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,740
So what I thought to myself is…

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,480
"I'm going to try to figure it out using a separate installation."

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,960
So I took everything down, took out my drives and everything, and used a spare drive to install.

15
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,080
And get this, I was installing on a HDD.

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,880
So it was crazy slow, not to mention when we're doing this on Windows 11, it's almost impossible to set things up there.

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,080
But I still got it anyway, and I did a really long series of tests.

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,220
I've gone through like 30 whole minutes of recordings.

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,160
I mean no, not just recording, streaming even.

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,540
I've done 30 whole minutes of streaming, and it was like, "huh, nothing happened."

21
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,260
Weird, isn't it?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,720
So I was streaming to a test private stream.

23
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:49,160
Just to make sure that the setup that I was recreating the error from was almost mirror, like one on one, the same.

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,940
So I got VSeeFace, everything on.

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,340
So nothing happened.

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:01,000
So I thought to myself, could it be that by reseating the GPU, things have fixed again?

27
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,120
Because honestly, I genuinely don't know what could make a GPU fall out.

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,500
Like, I got it real secured with screws and everything.

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:16,600
I mean, of course I don't have a GPU stand that most 4080 or 4090 people start using.

30
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,400
But how could it be possible?

31
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:28,760
Because I got my motherboard fresh just a couple months ago, like probably some three months ago or something.

32
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,780
Sometime around then.

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,520
So I thought to myself, this is really, really, really fucking weird.

34
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,200
So I put back everything, thinking that it could not be a GPU problem.

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,760
I put everything back, all my drives back to where it was.

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,660
And as you can see with my background, this is still my stream chatting background.

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,740
As you can see, everything is perfectly fine.

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
So I thought, let's do another series of tests.

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,040
Let's run the same game, do the same stream, do the same test.

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,960
Maybe even add an extra few loads, run a few YouTube videos on top of it.

41
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,020
Do everything.

42
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,580
What?

43
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,740
Nothing fucking crashed for a full hour straight.

44
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,140
30 minutes of ZZZ, 30 minutes of Valorant, nothing fucking happened.

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
Get this, nothing changed.

46
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,920
I have not even shut down any of my background services.

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,720
Nothing changed.

48
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,700
Nothing changed from prior, except for the fact that I reseated the GPU.

49
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,000
Just how fucking crazy is that?

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,300
Is it because of my GPU?

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,500
Is it because of my drives?

52
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,820
Because these are the only two components I've touched so far.

53
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,620
So I'm starting to lose my goddamn mind right now.

54
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,380
I really wish that these two are not the culprits.

55
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,940
Because currently, what's in my mind right now is a possible power supply failure as well.

56
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,840
Because to those OGs who have known this channel for a very long time,

57
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,440
you would have known the great tragic death of my PC just last year.

58
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:10,160
So around that time, what happened was that I shot the motherboard real dead.

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,820
So the PCIe slots were dead.

60
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,380
That's the whole point of me changing the whole motherboard and the new processor.

61
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,260
So that's where I got it at March this year.

62
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,220
So it's not the motherboard problem again.

63
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:31,160
I don't think it's the GPU because I've been doing content for consistently three whole months now,

64
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,100
up until that ZZZ-Z stream.

65
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,280
Oh my god, I could not speak.

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,320
Up until the ZZZ stream, there were no issues.

67
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:49,060
Like playing One-Armed Cook, One-Armed Robber, Genshin Impact, a whole slew of other games.

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,620
None of that ever happened.

69
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,000
So my only possible, well, theory is only of the two.

70
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Either the GPU is getting shaken off by the subwoofers of my speakers,

71
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,940
which I don't know how that's possible.

72
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,540
By a microscopic level?

73
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,080
Honestly, everything's clicked in.

74
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,180
I'm not even joking.

75
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,980
This is by far the weirdest problem I have ever faced in my life.

76
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,960
And I really do not want to go through that ever again.

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,760
So, this may be a video for help.

78
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,420
I'm terribly sorry for those who are not able to contribute financially.

79
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,580
But to those who can, please check out my Ko-Fi or Throne.

80
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,860
Depending on the links you click, there might be different goals.

81
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,260
So if you like my long-term goal of doing a complete upgrade,

82
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,240
like a complete swap of every part that I can think of, check out my Throne.

83
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,900
Otherwise, if you're looking to maybe give me some funds for repair,

84
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,240
even though the goal is currently at the massive upgrade,

85
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,500
I might use this money to possibly repair and upkeep this PC instead.

86
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,860
Unless you specify in the message.

87
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,560
But yeah.

88
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,660
To those who are not able to contribute financially, it's perfectly fine.

89
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,680
It's a thought that counts.

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,940
But it would also be nice if you could share my other content.

91
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,220
Like say, videos, streams, stuff like that.

92
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,560
Just to gain some awareness to this video.

93
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,240
Try not to share directly to this video first.

94
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,540
I like people to enjoy my content first before they look into this video.

95
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,180
So if you do come across this video,

96
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,500
as a long-standing fan of MeloriTensei,

97
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,140
I hope for the best for this channel, if anything.

98
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,800
Because I don't really have a cash flow.

99
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,740
Nor do I have any form of income.

100
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,860
So there's really nothing sustaining me right now.

101
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,500
To those who have found this video through recommendations algorithm,

102
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,420
please do check out all my other content.

103
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,200
I hope you enjoy my content.

104
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,740
If you do like my content and you want to contribute to my channel,

105
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,980
into improving everything,

106
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,260
because most of the time I like putting my money back into my setup.

107
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,920
Because if there's anything that makes me happy,

108
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,960
it's the joy of discovering tech and experimenting with things.

109
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,560
However, this is one of those times where I might end up hitting a limit.

110
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,920
A mental limit for what I can handle when it comes to diagnosing problems.

111
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,180
In financial situations like this.

112
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,120
If this problem persists,

113
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,560
I mean I'm talking about the sudden shutdowns,

114
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,040
I would be playing 50-50 with my life.

115
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,080
I'll be sinking my bank account to send it to someone to look into this problem.

116
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,140
And I may or may not be able to get it fixed by then.

117
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,540
But for now, as I currently see,

118
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:23,120
it seems like the issue may have been in the clear.

119
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,380
I can't really say for sure that it is quote-unquote "resolved".

120
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,860
Like "DEFINITIVELY resolved".

121
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,680
But yeah, I'm basically in quite a fragile situation right now for this channel,

122
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,340
and for my computer, and my entire content creation life.

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,460
Check out the two links in my channel.

124
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,000
There won't be videos next week as well, and maybe in the next few weeks probably.

125
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:05,000
Because I'm still going to be focusing on the original goals of the hiatus that I called.

126
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,520
Which is to unite my assets and also subtitle my last and only video that I have to subtitle left.

127
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,760
Which is the One-Armed Cook video.

128
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,080
So yeah, once that's done, then I'll be back to making videos again.

129
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,600
Streams?

130
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,640
About streams though, I'll be doing some tests all along this week.

131
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:42,940
Hopefully by Friday, I'll be able to determine whether I can continue streaming on that Saturday or not.

132
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:51,940
But yeah, with that said, it's your girl, Melori Valentine.

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,040
I'll catch you on the next post, I guess.

134
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,480
OtsuMelo.
