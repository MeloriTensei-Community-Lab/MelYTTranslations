00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
This right here is a HTC Vive controller, completely dismantled.

2
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:08,620
And this right here is a battery, a brand new one.

3
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:11,030
KonMelo, it's ya Tech Wizardess girl, MeloriTensei.

4
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:16,380
And this right here is me trying to reassemble my HTC Vive controller.

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:21,070
So if you haven't read my community post, I had to suspend all of my VR streams,

6
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:27,170
primarily because the battery was bloating and it was just flat out not safe anymore to work with.

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:32,600
So I had to dispose of that battery and start an emergency funding for the battery.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,730
And thanks to y'all in Ko-fi, check out in the description below, you guys are great and really really awesome.

9
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:43,370
And by the way, yes, I did fund for both batteries, rest assured guys.

10
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:51,020
So we're gonna reassemble the entire controller and hopefully they'll all work in one piece and that should be fine.

11
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:52,020
Fine and dandy.

12
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:55,320
We're gonna follow the iFixit Toolkit Guide in reverse.

13
00:00:55,316 --> 00:01:00,100
So hopefully we get this done really really quickly and let's just get on with it.

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,520
It's gonna be a really short off-the-cuff recording session,

15
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:09,470
primarily because there is only a single block of battery out of the third that is remaining on this camera.

16
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:12,120
So I gotta get this job done really really quickly.

17
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:19,430
But hopefully you guys can enjoy this short little run-and-gun content while I'm still away on hiatus as of the time of recording.

18
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:20,230
And let's get on with it.

19
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:29,280
So we got right here an iFixit tray that has already been sorted out by where the position in the controller they are at.

20
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:36,020
So like the saucers are all on the top and then I don't quite remember, I've already dismantled the controller some time ago.

21
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:38,580
It's been like probably two weeks at this point.

22
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:43,000
But hopefully I can still follow the instructions backwards nonetheless.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,070
So let's get on with it.

24
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:51,630
So we got right here a battery holder and all we have to do is just put it on but I don't remember the order of that.

25
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:54,420
So I'm just gonna take a look at the image and see how that goes.

26
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,930
Okay, about that.

27
00:01:55,933 --> 00:02:00,730
So what we do is we have them like this.

28
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:02,670
It's a little hard handling with gloves, huh?

29
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:06,270
In it goes and we can now rest it on.

30
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:10,730
We'll reconnect the power later but first we're gonna screw it on.

31
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:12,220
So they use Torx 5.

32
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:15,930
Okay.

33
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:29,570
These guys might need a little bit more force albeit a little bit scary because some of which have thread lockers so they might be a little bit on the tighter end.

34
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,870
Alright, next step.

35
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:31,800
Phillips.

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:40,170
Okay, this got a little confusing because the instruction says Phillips but unfortunately mine seems to be Torx.

37
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:47,080
I don't know if I'm in the wrong or something but I'm gonna stick with what I have for layouts.

38
00:02:50,816 --> 00:03:01,900
And according to the guide there was a little metal frame here that was supposed to be protecting the battery connectors but unfortunately for both of my controllers I don't seem to have something like that.

39
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:11,980
So I'm just gonna screw it down the traditional way with these Torx right here because they're right here according to my own tray map it does seem like they're using Torx instead.

40
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:27,020
So I'm not too sure if it was the generational difference or something's a little different with my unit but I'm just gonna go vibe with it because in the end of the day as long as you're not breaking anything they kind of still works.

41
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:47,570
Right, now we're reaching to a point where we need to reattach the battery so because I'm gloved up it might be a little hard to use your fingers to put it down so I'm gonna use my trusty little tool to slide it in and click it in place just like that.

42
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:50,520
There, it's now resting in place just fine and…

43
00:03:50,516 --> 00:04:02,700
Oh right right right, so this little sticker right here that has been sitting on top of this thing this is what's been holding on the connector this whole time so I'm just gonna reuse it for now just like so.

44
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:10,930
There isn't really any importance with the tape it's just I don't know it's there because it's there like you can see that there's even those tapes right here.

45
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:16,320
I don't know what's up with my unit somebody's gotten lazy or something but eh we're gonna vibe with it anyways.

46
00:04:16,316 --> 00:04:34,980
And looking at the instructions now we're gonna need to get the front panel which is this guy right here reconnected so we got one connector down here and then we got one connector up no wait two connectors up here one right here and one right here so we're gonna need to get it connected just as so.

47
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:57,130
And click that baby right in but just before we click it in let's have a test on the battery power.

48
00:04:57,283 --> 00:05:01,920
Oh we got the sound very nice now let's shut it back down.

49
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:06,720
Okay good to see that it's functional so let's click it in.

50
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:12,520
Right now so we click that in we're gonna try to reassemble the saucers.

51
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:19,020
These guys right here let's put the other battery out of the way and let's get to work.

52
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,630
And there you have it.

53
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:38,400
We got ourselves a functioning controller.

54
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:46,430
Well I'm gonna do more tests with the controller in the coming time so we're gonna jump into that time once I'm done with it.

55
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:54,170
Right we're in SteamVR now and I'm just here to record a very very short clip of that hey it works as you can see.

56
00:05:54,166 --> 00:06:08,200
So like the grip buttons are working the touch are also working the menus are working as you can see, even the menu buttons are working for both devices.

57
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,080
So yeah they're both fully functional, very nice.

58
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:21,170
Now there is one standing problem however, um, while everything's working like the touchpad everything is working the vibration for this controller somehow stopped working.

59
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:28,500
So I'm probably gonna work on that and investigate what's going on off camera off video in a future time.

60
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,400
But nonetheless I hope you enjoyed this video and back to the past Mel.

61
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,770

66
00:06:54,866 --> 00:07:02,230
So yeah as of the time I'm recording I am currently on hiatus so I'm not sure when I'll be coming back to edit this video.

67
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:10,000
So this video might be a little extra late and outdated so yeah with that said thank you all so much for watching.

68

[MeloriTensei 転性メロリ] Thank you for watching!
Check out my other contents!

75
00:07:37,383 --> 00:07:39,970
Wow autofocus please chill.

76
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:41,770
There's a single block of battery left.

77
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:43,320
Oh my god.

78
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:46,120
Okay, let's try to get on with it very quickly.

79
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:51,480
If that dies I have to bring a phone in to record this.

80
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:54,600
Hey to those sticking to the end of the video.

81
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,120
I still got one more controller to work with.
