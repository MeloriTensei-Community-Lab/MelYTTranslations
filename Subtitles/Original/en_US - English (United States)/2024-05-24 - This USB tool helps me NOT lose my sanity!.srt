1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,949
Imagine this,

2
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:01,933
you're a technician,

3
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:06,300
and you got a whole lot of computers to completely reinstall operating systems.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,166
but they all vary from one operating system to another.

5
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:12,400
Say one guy wants Windows 10 and the other guy wants Windows 11.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,866
And then this other dude wants Ubuntu Linux.

7
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:17,666
And then some weirdo wanna install RedStar OS!
(North Korean Anthem Intensifies)

8
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:21,166
Now you won't have to format your USB drive again and again and again

9
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,083
because this is where Ventoy comes in.

10
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,683
It is basically a bootloader that loads up

11
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:29,016
ISOs that you can save in bulk in that same USB.
(Windows noises)

12
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:32,516
Potentially saving you time, saving you space, whatnot.

13
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:35,500
We're just gonna cut the crap and get straight to it because...

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,283
there you have it!

15
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:36,983
That's the video.

16
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:39,800
(Outro Music)

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,383
(Sike)

18
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:40,816
What?

19
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:41,733
You're expecting more?

20
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:42,650
Alright, fine.

21
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,716
I'm recording this in daytime anyways,

22
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:46,449
there's gonna be lots of noise in the background.

23
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:48,933
But yeah, here are all the features that you'll be expecting.

24
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:53,099
but to put it in layman's terms: Very flexible, very customizable.

25
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:53,849
Simple as that.

26
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:55,066
How about we get straight into it?

27
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:57,750
So first thing what you got to do is click on Downloads,

28
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,599
and based on the operating system that you're currently on, pick them.

29
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:02,916
If you're on Windows, then you you gotta be on Windows,

30
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:03,366
duh.

31
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:05,050
And you should expect your files right here.

32
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,716
And the first thing you want to load up is Ventoy2Disk.

33
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:09,300
This will need your admin permissions.

34
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,266
So obviously you're going to need it on,

35
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:12,916
and then you get yourself this thing.

36
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,266
This is where you plug in your USB of choice.

37
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:18,466
Back up everything on your USB because you're gonna lose it all.

38
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:20,116
It's going to erase everything in the drive.

39
00:01:20,116 --> 00:01:21,233
Now we got it plugged in.

40
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,966
Let's refresh and we get ourselves the USB that we want.

41
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:25,816
And now what you want to do is look into the options

42
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:27,900
because there may be some things that you might want.

43
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,633
So say for example: you want secure boot because you already had secure boot on,

44
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,516
for say, the motherboard or the chipset you're on.

45
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:35,900
Then you would want to have that.

46
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,116
Otherwise, you're gonna need to turn it off whenever you use it.

47
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:40,949
And then on to partition style.

48
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:44,633
This would be very dependent on the type of computers that you usually service.

49
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:47,283
If you're maintaining devices that are primarily really really old

50
00:01:47,283 --> 00:01:50,066
that are some time around 2013's and earlier,

51
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:53,966
you would want the older style of partition called Master Boot Record (MBR).

52
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:58,650
Otherwise modern devices would be fine with GPT aka GUID partition table.

53
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,233
I'm not gonna elaborate into that

54
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:00,966
Eheheh~

55
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:03,349
And then when you get into partition configuration,

56
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:07,150
this is where you can customize the file system that you want for for the USB.

57
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,150
I highly recommend, if possible, avoid FAT32

58
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,966
because FAT32 as a file system has a 4GB limit per file.

59
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:17,716
And some installers these days are larger than it

60
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:21,449
Say for example a particular ISO of Windows

61
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:26,816
that has both 32-bit 64-bit Home, Pro, Home N, Pro N...

62
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:29,766
Pro K, Home K and so forth.
(Basically all the variants of Windows)

63
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:32,683
So in those cases you would prefer exFAT or NTFS

64
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:34,133
Though, I would recommend exFAT

65
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,283
But I'm going to use NTFS for my own case.

66
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:38,266
And then you gotta press OK to confirm that obviously.

67
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:41,116
And double check the settings that you have for Ventoy in package

68
00:02:41,116 --> 00:02:43,150
 to make sure that this is exactly what you want.

69
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,599
Because when you click install, there's no turning back.

70
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,900
Warning: The device will be formatted and all the data will be lost.

71
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,566
Continue?

72
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:50,116
Yes.

73
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:50,983
Double check.

74
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:51,633
Yes.

75
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:52,583
Now it's doing its job.

76
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,633
We're gonna give it some time

77
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,683
Congratulations: Ventoy has been successfully installed to the device.

78
00:02:56,683 --> 00:02:57,150
Great

79
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,616
So in the future if there's a new Ventoy version,

80
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:02,666
you can just download the same installer and click update instead 

81
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,716
and this would just update the Ventoy bootloader

82
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,750
 into the USB without affecting your settings

83
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,416
Right before we get into the drives, we're gonna figure out what's going on

84
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,583
So we're gonna need Disk Management.

85
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:18,883
And what's really going on is that Ventoy has created two different partition,

86
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:21,783
one is particularly for for the for the motherboard to boot into,

87
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:25,683
and a separate one that is specifically where you store all the ISOs,

88
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:28,433
and this is currently visible right now as it is mounted.

89
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:29,516
So we're gonna get into that.

90
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:31,349
Now that we're here on the Ventoy folder,

91
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:34,033
as you can see it's currently deserted and really empty.

92
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,783
This is where you start piling up your ISOs.

93
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,300
You can do it however you like.

94
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,616
The same way as how you keep them in your hard drive.

95
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:43,250
It supports any kind of directory style.

96
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,283
Just do it and just go ham until you run out of storage.

97
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:48,066
Now, with that said,

98
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:51,416
We're gonna get into the second program that we can see right here

99
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,199
It's called VentoyPlugson.

100
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,433
Basically Ventoy comes with a plug-in system that you can customize your Ventoy installation with

101
00:03:58,433 --> 00:03:59,483
So we're gonna run that.

102
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:00,733
And just before anything starts,

103
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:05,416
It's going to ask which drive that you want Ventoy Plugson to connect to

104
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,266
Then you start it,

105
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:08,699
And then your browser will open up a new tab

106
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,766
that takes you to the Ventoy Plugson UI.

107
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:12,633
This is where you start customizing.

108
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:16,333
So the first page starts with everything about the information about your drive,

109
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,183
 and then following next is the Global Control plugin.

110
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:22,933
Basically, what this does is that you can change the default settings

111
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:25,733
of how Ventoy behaves on the menu.

112
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,500
So you can change the menu language.

113
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,216
You can also change where it starts to search from

114
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:33,866
and tell it whether to bypass Windows 11's check by default

115
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:37,566
same goes to NRO aka network requirements in case you don't know.

116
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:39,349
And you can also set menu mode.

117
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:42,466
 Say for example, you have a cascade of folders.

118
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:46,800
Then you can set it to tree mode so you can go in by by the way you do your folders.

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,933
Rather than list view mode which lists everything it sees from top to bottom.

120
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:52,099
And then for menu timeout,

121
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,566
basically, what it does is it boots automatically

122
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:57,366
to your currently selected image in that said countdown.

123
00:04:57,366 --> 00:05:00,583
Should be pretty much the same as when you dual-boot stuff or

124
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:04,016
when you're loading into some operating system in some way.

125
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:06,716
And there's a whole slew of of different settings that you can set,

126
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:09,750
And they all have descriptions that explain to you what it does.

127
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,699
So that's pretty cool

128
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,016
Now following next is my absolute favorite: the theme plug-in

129
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:18,800
So in case you don't know, Ventoy is based on grub, a bootloader made for Linux.

130
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,883
Well, mostly Linux.

131
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:22,516
So since it's based on grub, you could in theory

132
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:25,416
just look for themes through gnome-look.org

133
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,566
and look specifically for grub themes

134
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:31,400
and there there will be a whole lot of choices of amazing themes

135
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,966
that you can customize the look of your Ventoy with.

136
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,933
You can also do the same with the normal grub

137
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:37,800
because they're technically the same thing anyways.

138
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,949
However, we're not gonna follow whatever's over here

139
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:41,333
because that's for normal grub.

140
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,349
We're using Ventoy,

141
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:44,400
so this is going to be a special case for us.

142
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,750
Say for example, you have found a theme that you wanted

143
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,333
and then you want to apply it to your Ventoy.

144
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,166
How do we do that?

145
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,333
It's really really simple

146
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,383
First up you got to download the theme file.

147
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:56,166
Now different themes would have different file structures.

148
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,849
Say for example, you want it on 1080p 

149
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,533
then they will call it fullHD.tar.

150
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:04,216
But it is the creators choice to how they sort out their files.

151
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:06,666
So you're going to need to pay attention on the file name

152
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,099
Right, let's get straight to downloading.

153
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:09,116
Once you're done downloading

154
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:11,783
we're gonna need to start extracting the archive.

155
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:14,733
Choose your favorite archive manager and extract the file.

156
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:18,750
If possible, go even deeper into the .tar file as well

157
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,533
Because what we need is the folder.

158
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,650
Following everything that it has

159
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,033
and the most important one: the theme.txt file.

160
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:29,016
Because the theme.txt file consist of information

161
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:31,183
that grub needs to apply as a theme.

162
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,216
So what we need to do is take this out

163
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:35,716
and if you feel like it, for organization purposes,

164
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:38,833
create a folder called themes

165
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,083
That way it's much neater for you

166
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,800
You can put it anywhere even in Ventoy's own folder

167
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,116
and put the entire theme folder into this.

168
00:06:46,116 --> 00:06:49,083
So now we got the theme and the theme.txt file.

169
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,099
What we need to do is get back to Plugson

170
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:54,099
and add the directory to the theme as an option.

171
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,000
So we paste it here...

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,150
and you gotta make sure you have theme.txt on as well.

173
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,449
Now it has found the theme it should apply on its own.

174
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:04,699
You can also add different types of font that you like,

175
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,750
and you can also set the graphics settings for this.

176
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,083
For which default resolution grub should run on,

177
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,400
I'm gonna set mine to 1080p for convenience.

178
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,416
But hey, it's your choice and theme's choice

179
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,366
Now below here are all different types of plugins

180
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:18,616
that personally I have not really used.

181
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:20,900
But they do seem really really useful

182
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,533
Especially with particularly auto install.

183
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,866
Say, you have a lot of different machines

184
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,466
that you want to install at bulk

185
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:28,816
but you don't want to go through the setup

186
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,016
because you're getting really lazy.

187
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,866
So, auto install just does the whole installation process completely unattended

188
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,666
completely unattended so things gets faster for you.

189
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,166
And then you also got the password plugin

190
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,233
where you can lock your ventoy with specific passwords.

191
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,750
So when people end up stealing your drive

192
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,033
They can't get into it,

193
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,833
or at least get into booting it to say the least.

194
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,066
Right. Now with that said.

195
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:50,333
We're gonna close Plugson.

196
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,366
And don't forget to stop it as well, and exit.

197
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:54,816
And now it's the matter of populating your drive.

198
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:57,900
So I may kind of be a data hoarder in some sense,

199
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,250
where I collect a massive size of ISOs

200
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,716
 so huge that it piles up to the hundreds

201
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:09,766
So I'm probably gonna copy a small handful of them

202
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:11,650
just to illustrate an example

203
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,133
Let's see... I'm gonna copy Ubuntu.

204
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,449
Maybe a bit of Manjaro.

205
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,583
Oh, oh ,oh.

206
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,916
Maybe maybe a bit of Windows 11

207
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,050
Maybe one of my favorite toolbox ever HirenBoot (Hiren's Boot CD).

208
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,733
Basically, it's kind of like system rescue (on Linux) but Windows

209
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:29,433
Maybe even memtest64+ just to illustrate

210
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:33,083
that I may be that one technician that might want to do some testings

211
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,166
And of course with every USB drive

212
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,433
they always take centuries to transfer.

213
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,600
So we're gonna sit right here and wait

214
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:42,033
Narrator: Two hours later~

215
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:46,033
Right, now that I've populated with the ISOs that I want to bring in.

216
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:49,883
We can now just unplug the USB and boot off from that USB.

217
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:50,550
Let's do it

218
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:52,333
ERGH!!!
(Windows Disconnect sound)

219
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,616
Just get 'er plugged in...

220
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:57,283
With Ventor now plugged in, we're gonna power it on.

221
00:08:57,283 --> 00:08:58,800
And get straight to the BIOS

222
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:00,016
Awh, drat.

223
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:02,500
And we're gonna boot into the BIOS.

224
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,449
Now that we're in the BIOS, you can see that in the list of boot devices

225
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:09,449
There is my USB so we're gonna try to boot into that.

226
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,716
And there you have it

227
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,100
If you remember that we have previously set a theme

228
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,516
This is the theme that we got.

229
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:18,066
If you do not wish to have a theme momentarily

230
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:21,100
and you wanted more clearer view of the grub controls.

231
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,533
You could just press F7,

232
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:24,883
and it should give you the plain version of grub again.

233
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:27,466
And as you can see it shows everything that I have.

234
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,850
And there's a whole slew of options that you can use

235
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,783
such as you can you can shut it back down as well,

236
00:09:32,783 --> 00:09:34,483
you can also look at look into your hardware info,

237
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:37,783
set resolutions, set your display modes and so forth.

238
00:09:37,783 --> 00:09:39,666
This is all what we've been coming for.

239
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:45,016
The ability to enter any of these OSes without having to format your USB

240
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:46,783
That's where the convenience comes in.

241
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:49,116
So say for example, I'm in the mood of Manjaro.

242
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:50,616
Let's just boot it in right now

243
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:51,616
And here we are.

244
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:53,533
We're in we're kind of in Manjaro's bootloader.

245
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:56,266
And we can just pick our usual choices and stuff 

246
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:58,416
and install the operating system as we please,

247
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,483
just like a normal operating system installer.

248
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:03,083
Say for example, I'm not feeling like Manjaro

249
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:05,033
How about Windows?

250
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,833
Yes, you can.

251
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,199
And there we have it, a Windows installation media.

252
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:12,666
So like I said, Ventoy is a very versatile bootloader.

253
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,683
So, I have my own USB stick that I'm actually actively using

254
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:20,300
as my utility toolkit for these kinds of things.

255
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,133
So I'm gonna show you how mine looks like

256
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:28,316
So I basically set mine to have a theme of Honkai Star Rail 

257
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:31,166
and a whole slew of different kinds of themes.

258
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,250
And I've also have tree-mode enabled,

259
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,399
so it'd be sorted by the folders I've set.

260
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,316
So like say, I've sorted it by Linux and Windows.

261
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:40,466
So, if I want Linux I go in there.

262
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:42,750
Just like how you usually navigate a folder with...

263
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,850
Say I want... I want Ubuntu but Ubuntu is based on Debian.

264
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,816
So I sorted it that way, [Debian] and then [Ubuntu].

265
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:55,083
And then all my Ubuntu is over here and so forth, that kind of way.

266
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,833
and then we got Windows, we got Windows 10, Windows 11...

267
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,983
It's all pretty simple

268
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:01,100
Now say I still don't want this kind of theme.

269
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,116
I could just do that

270
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:03,866
See, now everything's simple again.

271
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,050
Now say I don't like the current theme I'm on.

272
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,233
You could just select the theme

273
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,166
and this is all the installed themes I've currently got.

274
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,466
Say I'd say I'm not in the mode of Black Swan from Honkai Star Rail at the moment

275
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,149
I'm more of a Sparkle simp.

276
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:16,533
We can turn on Sparkle,

277
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:19,466
re-enable my theme and there we have it. We got Sparkle.

278
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:21,116
Now say if I'm not into Sparkle

279
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:22,949
and I'm not into Honkai Star Rail at the moment.

280
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,449
I can just pick any other theme.

281
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:26,633
Like say a simple just black theme, you know.

282
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:29,183
A very very simple one, nothing too complex.

283
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:31,966
Or a very 8-bit looking style kind of theme.

284
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:32,616
But yeah.

285
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:36,000
With that said, that's pretty much all I can show you about Ventoy.

286
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,899
But if you do know better use cases for all the other plugins,

287
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,100
let me know in the comments below.

288
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,083
and hopefully more people can understand what you can do with Ventoy.

289
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:43,633
And with that said,

290
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:46,050
I'm gonna link the resources in the description below.

291
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,116
And thanks for watching and I'll see you guys next time.

292
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:50,266
OtsuMelo deshita (It's been ya girl Mel).

293
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,699
See ya~

294
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,050
ERGH!!!
