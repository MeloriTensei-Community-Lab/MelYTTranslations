1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,120
Salutations!

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,680
Welcome to Melori's Tensei's…

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh, Melori's Tensei?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,991
What the fuck?

5
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:08,000
Heh.
Pfft.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,640
So, you're an iPhone user like I am.

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,520
Pretty much an iPhone user that 
does not use the ecosystem.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, salutations!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,840
I'm Melori Valentine, and 
this is my personal guide

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,840
to ditching the walled garden ecosystem.

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,440
Though with disclaimer,

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,880
that some of the services that I'll be using

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,040
might not necessarily respect your privacy.

14
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,000
So, please do your own 
research about these services.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There might be some services that might 
be a bit of an anti-feature for you.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,120
So, for those privacy-concerned users,

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,000
please stick around in the video, 
and I'll show you a very cool list.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,160
Or you can just jump straight 
to the description and just…

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,840
I don't know.

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,360
That's the end of the video for you, I guess.

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,600
Okay.
I'm nah…

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm just joking.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,680
Alright.

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,160
Let's get straight to…

25
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,040
First up, the biggest elephant in the room.

26
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,640
Because I know many people 
will click off this video,

27
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,520
and they're gonna go away and say 
goodbye and crash my algorithm.

28
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,480
So, we're gonna go straight from 
the biggest to the smallest instead.

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,360
So, first up is going to be…

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,520
Photo Sync!

31
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,200
Now, we all have precious photos 
that we like to sync up to the cloud,

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,600
so that nothing gets lost, 
even on the time of taking.

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,480
So, what do we use?

34
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,320
So, for me, however, I use two 
different solutions at the same time.

35
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,680
The first one being using MEGA.

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,720
So, MEGA is pretty popular as 
one of the cloud services that…

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,000
Quote-unquote, "online privacy for 
everyone", or cares for privacy.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,080
So, you either take their word for 
it, or do a plenty of research.

39
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,840
And speaking of research, two years 
ago, as of the filming this video,

40
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,360
there might be a little bit 
of a trust problem with MEGA.

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,600
So, for me, I do trust MEGA a little bit,

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,800
as long as my photos are not really 
mission-critical or sensitive.

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,160
So, you be your own judge for this.

44
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,680
I'll link those resources 
in the description below.

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,280
Now, for the second one, in case 
MEGA goes to shit, I use SeaFile.

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Well, SeaFile is mainly a personally 
self-hosted cloud sync server.

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,960
So, this also means you need a little bit of a 
technical know-how to be able to host a server.

48
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,160
However, functionality-wise, it is more 
or less the same as MEGA, Google Drive,

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,440
a plenty lot, but it is a little, 
kind of like, clean-looking, I guess?

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,320
It doesn't come smacking at you with, 
like, premium features this and that,

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,160
because you have control over your files.

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,240
This sounds like a really awesome idea.

53
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,120
So, this is my current secondary backup option.

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,120
So, there you have it.

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,400
However, SeaFile do come with, 
well, kind of bare of features.

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,760
Like, how do I say this?

57
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,360
You have extremely basic Office, 
and that's pretty much it.

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,240
You can't really do much of it, like, 
sharing notes, that does not exist yet.

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,040
So, this is where NextCloud comes in.

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,400
NextCloud is a lot more whole 
and a lot more complete,

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,000
because it is more catered 
to the corporate platform.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,840
And even if you do host it 
on your casual platform,

63
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,520
it kind of feels professional to some extent.

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,960
I'm also personally a NextCloud user.

65
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,040
However, I don't find myself using 
all the features on NextCloud,

66
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,920
so I can't really say too much for 
the features that are available there.

67
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,000
But once again, with SeaFile and NextCloud, so,

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,920
the security can only be as 
good as the hosters themselves.

69
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,280
You gotta keep that in mind.

70
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,520
It's not really a one-click 
setup and forget solution.

71
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,040
You would have to take note of 
how you are supposed to host it,

72
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,160
how you're gonna configure it, 
and how you're gonna secure it.

73
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,680
Pretty much most of that.

74
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,720
However, it's still kind of 
setup and forget to some extent.

75
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,040
There are some bit of maintenance occasionally,  

76
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,040
like, from time to time, like 
months or something like that.

77
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,000
But if you're really, really privacy 
concerned or privacy conscious,  

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,120
this might be a solution for you.

79
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,000
Right, with photo sync and cloud sync out 
of the way, let's head on to the next one.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,760
So, if you happen to use Apple 
Keychain, and you thought to yourself,

81
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,880
how do I bring it to other platforms,

82
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,800
because I don't just use an 
iPhone and I don't just use a Mac.

83
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Let's say I got a Windows computer 
and I got everything else,

84
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,000
like Linux, Android, whatever that is.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,480
How do we bring them over?

86
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,960
Well, obviously, you gotta ditch the Keychain.

87
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,600
There's really not much to say, 
you gotta ditch the Keychain.

88
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,040
So, there are a few more alternatives 
they can pick up instead of the Keychain.

89
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,440
And on the very top, I got Bitwarden.

90
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,760
Bitwarden is one of my personal favorite

91
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,760
because its code can be independently audited.

92
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,400
Though I may not necessarily be a security expert,

93
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,680
it is that bit of assurance that 
professionals can check the code

94
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,760
and call out to the public for 
that, should there be any issues.

95
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,880
And accountability can be 
held on Bitwarden themselves,

96
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,760
which sounds really important to me

97
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,920
because I care more about a 
really clean and secure code

98
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,960
over a very paper guarantee from a company.

99
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,360
So, Bitwarden is definitely on the top of my list.

100
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,320
Now, Bitwarden lets you save passwords, notes,

101
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,160
and there's a little bit of secure vault.

102
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,640
However, you're gonna need 
a pro subscription for that,

103
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,240
unless you self-host your 
own server. (*Check desc)

104
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,120
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, however,

105
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,680
Bitwarden does give you an option to 
self-host your own Bitwarden server.

106
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,080
So, you can store your password in your own server

107
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,920
rather than Bitwarden's own 
servers, which is pretty awesome,

108
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,680
but I don't really do that for myself

109
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,080
because I don't really trust my own server.

110
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,480
I'll explain in a moment.

111
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,160
Now, following down the list, we got ProtonPass.

112
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,040
ProtonPass, however, I have 
not personally used ProtonPass,

113
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,240
but I am a user within the Proton ecosystem,

114
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,280
namely ProtonMail and ProtonVPN.

115
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,960
However, I've never really experienced ProtonPass,

116
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,280
so you be your own judge, give it a try,

117
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,280
maybe do a little bit of a 
back and forth testing with it.

118
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,000
But, I have trusted Proton as 
a company for quite some time.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,760
There may be one particular incident,

120
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,120
but it can get a teeny tiny bit concerning

121
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,000
depending on how far is your boundaries 
to what you allow Proton to log.

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,400
They say zero logging, but obviously they 
refer to the content that is zero logging,

123
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,640
but your access logs might still be there.

124
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,200
So, please keep that in mind.

125
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,920
That may potentially be a law in some places,

126
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,480
so this might be a little bit of a factor

127
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,760
that might be a tipping point for some people 
who are really, really privacy sensitive.

128
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,800
Moving on to a really 
proprietary* company, Dashlane.

129
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,440
So, I have previously used Dashlane before,

130
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,400
however, at the time, it was like 
many, many years ago already.

131
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,000
You might have heard of Dashlane 
sponsoring a lot of YouTubers

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,480
and basically just promoting their 
password manager and so forth.

133
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,160
That is at least, they've done it after LastPass,

134
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,680
but we'll get to that in a moment.

135
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,960
And I thought to myself, maybe 
I should give Dashlane a try.

136
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,760
Maybe, let's see what's different about it.

137
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,400
And when I tried it, it's pretty awesome 
that when you do pay for a subscription,

138
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,880
that means you also have a file vault.

139
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,560
That's cool.

140
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,400
So, I kept a lot of documents at the 
time in there, and that is pretty cool.

141
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,760
However, I do have one personal complaint.

142
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,680
I'm not sure this is resolved yet because 
I'm no longer a Dashlane customer.

143
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,320
But as of many, many years ago in my past,

144
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,400
at that time, Dashlane was 
acting a little bit funny.

145
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,040
I'm not talking about like privacy funny.

146
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,560
I mean like behavioral funny.

147
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,440
It's like sometimes it bugs out 
with the auto-fill features.

148
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,120
Sometimes even with the saving feature, 
sometimes I might lose some entries,

149
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,880
but particularly the ones that 
I created brand new instead.

150
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,680
The existing ones stay the way it 
is, but it's kind of funny still.

151
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,760
Like, it kind of did get in my way and it 
takes off like a couple of minutes of my time.

152
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,840
Which is not really wise as a university 
student at the time of subscription.

153
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,440
So, Dashlane, if you have fixed it,  

154
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,760
please let me know in the comments 
below if you happen to be watching this.

155
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,280
Though I won't guarantee you 
that I'll be a customer again

156
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,000
because I currently don't have money.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,120
Right, moving on.

158
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,960
There is a password manager I would like 
you to completely ignore at the moment.

159
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,200
Personally, at least.

160
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,480
It is LastPass.

161
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
So, I have used LastPass before.

162
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,120
LastPass as a product was really really good.

163
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,080
Like I genuinely like it and sponsors 
weren't really lying about it.

164
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,920
However, ever since its previous 
security breach long long time ago,

165
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,200
it kind of got a little bit concerning 
for me to the point that it's like,

166
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,640
"can I trust them any longer?"

167
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,520
And it kind of got a little 
bit, well, very worrying.

168
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,960
It's like you paid to get hacked?

169
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,000
Huh?

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,040
So, I thought to myself, you know what?

171
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,600
I'm out.

172
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,320
Sorry.

173
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,840
That's how I switched to Dashlane.

174
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,200
It's kind of wild.

175
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,960
However, LastPass said that they're 
going to keep enforcing the security

176
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,520
and leveling up the security.

177
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,800
So, my personal advice is threat with extreme 
caution if you insist of using LastPass.

178
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,280
However, I would have recommended 
you to use Bitwarden instead.

179
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,120
Right, moving on.

180
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,760
Two-factor authentication.

181
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,120
Particularly, the ones 
where you have to type those

182
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,000
four-digit or six-digit or eight-digit numbers

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,440
whenever you need to log in to 
some places like websites like Yu-

184
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,120
Yugo?

185
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,040
What the fuck?

186
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,160
Some places like Google, 
Facebook, Instagram, so forth.

187
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,400
Man, I'm such a boomer.

188
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,440
You would need something that's kind of basic

189
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,160
and usually these websites will tell 
you to install Google Authenticator

190
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,040
or Microsoft Authenticator.

191
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,480
I would personally go against 
that and I'll explain in a moment.

192
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,080
But first, we'll get it 
right into the alternatives.

193
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,040
My top recommendation, however, is 2FAS.

194
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,800
So, 2FAS is amazing and it's really 
snappy and it's kind of transparent

195
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,280
and you can also audit the code 
similar to how Bitwarden does theirs.

196
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,800
It's honestly a very robust way to handle things.

197
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,280
They have talked a lot about their 
mentality on their YouTube channel.

198
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,120
So, I hope they keep that 
mentality throughout so far.

199
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,160
And I hope they don't sell out 
to some big giant corporate

200
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,320
like a certain company that I 
will talk about in a moment.

201
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,640
And the one good thing about 2FAS, however,

202
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,680
is that it allows you to use iCloud 
Sync to save your keys as a backup.

203
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,240
However, if you are not really comfortable 
with saving things in the cloud, that's fine.

204
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,680
Turn that toggle off and you'll 
be completely local again.

205
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,120
The one cool thing I really 
like about 2FAS, however,

206
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,840
is this amazing feature where you 
can just have a browser extension

207
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,280
and you just click on it...

208
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,320
And it pings your phone and you just press accept

209
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,080
and then it auto-fills the password for you.

210
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,120
So, you don't have to go look up and 
down and up and down for the keys.

211
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,640
Which I honestly think is 
seriously an awesome feature

212
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,360
for people who are really really lazy

213
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,600
or they just have limited access 
to the keypad on their keyboard

214
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,440
or something like that.

215
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,280
Or they just outright don't have a keypad.

216
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,160
Like say, TKL users.

217
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,440
TKL keyboard users.

218
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Yeah, I see you.

219
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,080
And 60% keyboard users.

220
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,160
Yeah, I see you too.

221
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,280
Hey, custom keyboards, let's go!

222
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,680
Anyways, back to the main topic.

223
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,560
And they also allowed you to export your keys

224
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,360
so you can bring it cross-platform 
to the Android side.

225
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,800
Say, you have both devices like I do.

226
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,560
Like say, both an iOS and an Android device.

227
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,680
I would export it and then I'll take it 
to the Android site and import it there.

228
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,480
So, I got two points of entry.

229
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,840
Though, preferences is always preferences.

230
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,600
So, you don't necessarily 
have to do exactly what I did.

231
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,480
But at least that's a 
scenario that you can imagine.

232
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,640
Right, following that, how do we make this better?

233
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,240
Clearly, there is a point of inconvenience for me.

234
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,000
So, you know how I just 
mentioned little seconds ago

235
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,720
about how you need to export the keys

236
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,640
and take it manually to the Android site.

237
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,760
How do we do this a lot more automatically?

238
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,240
And that's where I found Ente.

239
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,120
However, I have no personal experience with Ente.

240
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,280
But Ente seems like a photo sync platform.

241
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,440
A more encrypted photosync platform.

242
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,360
But it is under a subscription basis.

243
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,920
So, it kind of deterred me from considering Ente.

244
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,800
However, if you scroll just a little bit down

245
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,960
and you see products and you get Auth.

246
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,880
Wow, it's Ente Auth.

247
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,280
It's an authenticator that is 
free and cross-platform sync.

248
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,560
However, I don't have 
experience with Ente Auth yet.

249
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,720
But I am looking forward to 
try it out after this video.

250
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,720
So, if I do talk about securities or 2FAs 
or anything related to it on a video.

251
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,800
I would probably talk about 
my reviews on that video then.

252
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,000
Please do keep an eye on my channel 
and be sure to subscribe for that.

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,120
However, it sounds really really awesome that

254
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,480
it's kind of like 2FAS but a little 
more cloud-focused and encrypted.

255
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
It may not necessarily be a cup of tea

256
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,920
for people who are more local-focused 
rather than cloud-focused.

257
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,320
So, if you are more of that 
person, 2FAS would be for you.

258
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,840
However, there is an alternative to 
2FAS when it comes to being local.

259
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,840
There is Aegis Authenticator*.

260
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,960
Though I don't have personal 
experience with Aegis,

261
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:44,760
but I have heard of a lot of 
recommendations in the 2FA subreddit.

262
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,360
And there were plenty of them in fact.

263
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,240
The reason being is pretty simple.

264
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,760
You can just access the source 
code and audit the code yourself.

265
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,120
Which is pretty freaking awesome in my opinion.

266
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,200
It's kind of like the transparency 
is just there for you to see.

267
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,080
Which is kind of awesome.

268
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,760
And it's also available in F-Droid

269
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,080
which is an alternative 
download store that you can use

270
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,440
if you don't feel like wanting to use Google Play

271
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,120
or you just don't trust Google Play.

272
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,120
Or you rooted your device or you use a custom 
ROM that does not have Google Play Store

273
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,280
and you still do not want 
to have Google Play Store.

274
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,360
It's kind of awesome to have options like this.

275
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,480
So, big ups for Aegis.

276
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,760
Now, we're getting into the dangerous zone.

277
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,360
Now, let's get into those 
that we should avoid outright.

278
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,640
Ravio OTP.

279
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,840
Initially, Ravio was being 
recommended a lot by the subreddit.

280
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,800
However, ever so recently, Ravio 
has sold out to a sketchy company.

281
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,520
Sketchy enough that…

282
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,320
Here, let me get this.

283
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,560
Let me set the story for you, okay?

284
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,720
Ravio was competitive to Aegis

285
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,800
because its source code was open 
on GitHub during its launch.

286
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,920
However, ever since they got sold 
out to a big sketchy company,

287
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,760
that big sketchy company shut down the repo,

288
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,120
hid everything relating to 
transparency and all you got is this.

289
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
This website.

290
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,720
That's all there is to it.

291
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,160
Do you see where I'm going at right now?

292
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,520
Now, you catch my drift.

293
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,040
You don't know if this app is safe anymore or not

294
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,240
because there's no way to audit the code.

295
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,880
So, Ravio OTP for me is a big deal breaker.

296
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,240
Hell no, I'm not picking it up.

297
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,200
Thank you very much.

298
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,680
And here's another one.

299
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,280
Twilio Authy.

300
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,120
Now, Twilio Authy at the time of my usage,

301
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,080
it was really, really painful to use.

302
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,520
So for one, for logins, you need 
to use your phone number to log in,

303
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,640
which genuinely freaking suck.

304
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,240
And now, I think it seems like 
from looking at this documentation,

305
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,000
it looks like they made it even 
more confusing for people to use.

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,320
You still log in with your phone number.

307
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,400
And as you may know, SMS 
OTP is not exactly secure.

308
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:56,280
If you live in a place where it's 
susceptible to SIM swap or interceptions,

309
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,480
this will be really, really bad for you.

310
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,920
So, there's that.

311
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,760
So, that's a big no for me.

312
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,320
And lastly, Google Authenticator.

313
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,680
Now, Google keeps saying, "oh, we're 
securing everything in the background

314
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,040
and everything in the back is secure.

315
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,520
So, there won't be a hacking software 
that will be breaking into it."

316
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,040
Have you looked at what's in your face?

317
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,000
So, the problem with Google 
Authenticator, however,

318
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,360
is that if you can break 
whatever's in front of you,

319
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,640
you immediately get access to all the 
keys inside, which is not really good.

320
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,000
So, like, say for example, Google 
Passwords in Google Chrome.

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,720
If they can bypass your admin permissions, 
your secrets are no longer a secret.

322
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,040
Same logic goes to on your Android phone.

323
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,080
If your device has a security vulnerability 
that bypasses your screen lock,

324
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,360
you've set yourself up for a serious problem.

325
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,440
So, personally, I genuinely do not like 
Google Authenticator for that reason.

326
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,200
So, if you're using mission critical 
services or websites like this,

327
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,880
Google Authenticator is a hard no-no for me.

328
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,960
So, we're going to yeet that.

329
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,000
Speaking of yeeting, I've 
done it a long, long time ago.

330
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,320
Right, moving on.

331
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,960
So, if you remember from the photo 
section at the beginning of the video,

332
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,040
I talked about how you can 
synchronize your photos and stuff.

333
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,240
Let's say what about all your other stuff?

334
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,760
So, like, say your documents or programs 
that you want to back up or audio files,

335
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,680
anything outside of photos, what do we use?

336
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,920
Now, if you remember from earlier, you would 
see that SeaFile is back on the list again.

337
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,560
However, I would also bring in Nextcloud 
as well because both of them are kind of  

338
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,040
cool when it comes to being a file sync platform.

339
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,920
However, there is a downside to that, 
but we'll get to that in a moment.

340
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Now, say if you have a server that 
operates on an operating system like

341
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,280
unRaid, TrueNAS, Proxmox, and the sort.

342
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,160
Then you would usually find yourself 
using network attached storage

343
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,200
kind of thing called SMB or Samba.

344
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,640
And Samba is basically a protocol 
that allows you to connect

345
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,600
to network attached storage within your network.

346
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,520
It's also being used on Windows

347
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,160
and plenty of other platforms 
that happen to support it as well.

348
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,040
Which I would say pretty much if 
you have devices that are smart,

349
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,240
like your computer and your smartphone, 
you can pretty much access it.

350
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,440
No problem.

351
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,200
So, the Apple Files app genuinely 
sucks in various things.

352
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,280
You can even see that it is pretty evident 
on Linus Media Group's channel, Mac Address.

353
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,320
When Jonathan Horst complained about the 
Files app, there were plenty of complaints.

354
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,800
And one of which happens to resonate with me,  

355
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,320
which is the inability to 
refresh on the Files app.

356
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,080
What kind of stupid thing is that?

357
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,320
The inability to refresh 
with the Files app also means

358
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,200
you're unable to reestablish connections 
with your network attached storage.

359
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,640
That is, either you change passwords

360
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,400
or you've changed folder structures

361
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,760
so dramatically different that it 
is to the point of no recognition.

362
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,520
And the Files app would just think, oh, the 
file structure is basically still that way.

363
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,200
And then it will stay frozen in time forever.

364
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,600
How do we avoid that?

365
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,840
Well, sadly, you would have to 
resort to third-party solutions.

366
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,120
Which is where this program 
comes in, ES File Explorer.

367
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,080
It's an app made by a subsidiary of 
Baidu, so please be your own judge.

368
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,760
If you do think Baidu is a 
bit of a malicious company,

369
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,080
especially on their origins, 
please keep that in mind.

370
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,080
However, in my personal experience 
of using ES File Explorer,

371
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,040
if you have trackers completely turned 
off, it's kind of a pretty good app.

372
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,400
At least for the iOS side.

373
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,480
On the Android side, I would have recommended 
you to use Solid Explorer instead.

374
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,720
Whereas on the iOS side, I highly recommend 
using this because it carries things around.

375
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,480
At least it works in the kind of fashion.

376
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,280
If you do have any other File 
Explorer that you would recommend,

377
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,760
please let me know in the description below.

378
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,560
Description?

379
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,360
What the fuck?

380
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,160
That's the second time I've said this already.

381
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,800
Please let me know in the comments below.

382
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,600
So the one good thing about 
ES File Explorer, however,

383
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,960
is that when you want to take out 
your photos into your SMB servers,

384
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,320
you can just use it to move*.

385
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,520
Which means it will basically just copy the 
stuff over and then delete it on the local end.

386
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,320
So say you take a lot of videos 
and you want to take it out

387
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,600
like how you do with a USB drive or something.

388
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,720
This is like the network's version of it.

389
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,240
So in my personal opinion, this 
is genuinely kind of awesome.

390
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
However, there is a different solution.

391
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,280
So say you have a server that runs Syncthing,

392
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,560
which is one of the most awesome 
decentralized file synchronization program.

393
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,520
Which kind of is like, think of it 
like Soul Link in Honkai Impact.

394
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,040
I guess you don't play Honkai Impact then.

395
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,800
Don't worry about it.

396
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,360
Basically, if you kill one of them,

397
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,960
the other resurrects the one that you just killed.

398
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,680
So this is kind of an awesome idea in my opinion.

399
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,680
But that also means you would need 
to have both copies on both ends.

400
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,320
However, if that's kind of your cup of 
tea, then you would have Möbius Sync.

401
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,760
Though I haven't really used Möbius 
Sync because I don't really have money

402
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,360
to buy the full-fledged version to review.

403
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,640
So, uh…

404
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
However, I have used Syncthing 
in every other platform

405
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,720
that is available for free like 
Android, Windows, and so forth.

406
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,360
And it has been really, really robust.

407
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,280
And this is how I've been 
moving my files around so far.

408
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,000
So if you really, really want to consolidate 
your files in the form of Syncthing,

409
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,440
I would recommend doing that instead.

410
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,640
Right, moving on.

411
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,440
Now we've reached a point where we 
kind of go thinking to ourselves.

412
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,440
Okay, we've protected ourselves from the ecosystem

413
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,320
from most of the major standpoint.

414
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,640
Now let's get into the browser.

415
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,160
Now, the browser market may be a 
little teeny tiny bit funny and…

416
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,040
I don't know.

417
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,440
It's a little bit…

418
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,360
Ehhh…

419
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,760
You're going to trust at your own volition.

420
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,520
However, I have done my research

421
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,920
and plenty of people on the iOS subreddit 
has recommended to use Brave Browser.

422
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,520
Though Brave Browser does come with a 
built-in ad blocker and a built-in PIP.

423
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,960
So you can kind of just do whatever 
YouTube thing you couldn't do

424
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,480
on the free version on that browser.

425
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,120
To which I cannot legally directly address.

426
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,360
But it is kind of a janky way to do it.

427
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,160
And I kind of respect the hustle.

428
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,240
But Brave does more than just that.

429
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,440
They have a search engine of themselves,

430
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,160
which I haven't really gone around trying.

431
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,560
But apparently, they have their 
own search indexes as well.

432
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,680
So that's like independent of 
Bing, independent of Google.

433
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,000
And DuckDuckGo is based on Bing.

434
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,280
And you got SearX is kind of like based on Google.

435
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,040
Whoogle is also Google.

436
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,440
So Brave is like an index of its own.

437
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,720
Though I haven't gone around trying it,

438
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,560
so I can't really explain that to you just yet.

439
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,120
But if you do want the most basic 
tracking and ad blocking browser,

440
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,440
I guess Brave might be a good option.

441
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,560
However, alternatively, you 
can also try out Firefox.

442
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,400
However, Firefox does not come with ad blocking.

443
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,600
And extension support is 
only available on Android.

444
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,600
So Firefox is, if anything, the 
only thing that makes it convenient

445
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,920
is just if you happen to use Firefox on your PC,

446
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,760
then synchronizing the bookmarks and possibly tabs  

447
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,920
that you want to move over 
would be easier that way.

448
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,720
However, there's a tiny caveat.

449
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,400
So I have previously used Firefox before.

450
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,240
And there was a little bit 
funny going on in the code

451
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,720
that if you open and close your 
Firefox app way too quickly,

452
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,600
there are times where its cache gets so 
corrupted that all your tabs disappear.

453
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,200
I have two instances of mine where 
20-ish of my tabs all disappear

454
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,360
and I don't know how to retrieve it.

455
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,360
And that in itself is kind of concerning

456
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,840
because I couldn't even find it on Firefox sync.

457
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,440
So Mozilla, if you do catch that, 
I hope you can resolve this ASAP.

458
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,280
Now I get it, Mozilla.

459
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,120
I get it.

460
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,760
All browsers on iOS is more 
or less just Apple WebKit

461
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,040
with a little bit of a wrapper 
and extra stuff on top of it.

462
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,120
But come on, you got a big market here as well.

463
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,280
However, if you can't stand the anomalies 
that you get from third-party browsers

464
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,200
and you still want to stick with Safari,

465
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,920
I recommend you check out all 
these following extensions.

466
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,320
Hyperweb.

467
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,240
Hyperweb is kind of an all-in-one extension.

468
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,040
And you can do ad blocking,

469
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,400
overriding search engines so you 
can use your own search engine

470
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,040
instead of whatever Safari provides you.

471
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,800
And you can do custom CSS and 
JavaScript injection as what it says,

472
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,560
though I have not really used it myself.

473
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,240
So I can't really tell you.

474
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,920
Perhaps it may be something 
along the lines of TamperMonkey,

475
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,720
but I can't really guarantee you that either.

476
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,480
And there are also some additional features 
like creating custom search filters.

477
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,120
So the search filter will be a lot 
more biased to more trusted platforms.

478
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,720
Like say, if you're searching 
for something medical,

479
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,600
it will give you WebMD and other 
more trusted medical websites.

480
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,920
Also, don't call me on that about WebMD.

481
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,440
According to WebMD, you have cancer.

482
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,600
According to WebMD, you have cancer.

483
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,040
And following that, AdGuard for iOS.

484
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,680
AdGuard may be a little bit heavy.

485
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,320
So if you use the ad blocking feature on 
Hyperweb, I think it should be enough.

486
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,040
However, if you do want a 
bit of a sanity assurance,

487
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,440
then you should totally check out AdGuard as well.

488
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,160
AdGuard is kind of powerful on its free version,

489
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,920
so you can basically turn everything on.

490
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,840
However, your browsing experience might hitch

491
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,720
so much that it becomes probably like a 
loading time of four to five seconds, honestly.

492
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,200
But don't just take my word for it.

493
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,240
Experiment with your setup and see what suits you.

494
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,680
And there are three different other 
extensions that I use on the side of it

495
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,600
that kind of enhances the experience of Safari

496
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,360
so it feels less miserable.

497
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,400
One of which is Web Inspector.

498
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,920
And you might be very familiar 
if you're on a browser.

499
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,280
You press F12, that's the inspector.

500
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,200
Pretty much that.

501
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,640
So if you're into looking into web elements,

502
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,840
then I highly recommend Web Inspector.

503
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,120
And following that, PiPifier.

504
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,840
So you might be familiar 
with Picture-in-Picture view.

505
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,760
So like say, if you happen to be a YouTube 
Premium user, you would understand that.

506
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,960
Which is a feature that lets you, when you exit,

507
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,440
you can kind of have it in like a tiny window

508
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,840
that you can watch alongside 
as you do other stuff.

509
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,960
That's PiP.

510
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,200
However, obviously if you don't have 
Premium on YouTube, you can't do that.

511
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,560
But there is an extension 
that kind of lets you do that.

512
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,080
At least it works for the time 
being, at the time of filming.

513
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:29,040
And the PiPifier is available on the Mac 
App Store and namely, the iOS App Store.

514
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,160
So you can basically PiPify 
whatever videos that you're watching

515
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,320
on the Safari browser version of YouTube.

516
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,120
And following that, we got TLS Inspector.

517
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,480
TLS Inspector is basically what you 
would do when you click on the padlock

518
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,040
and look at the security information 
of this website you're currently on.

519
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,480
Say like, what kind of HTTP 
security it is and stuff like that.

520
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,440
View certificates and stuff like that.

521
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,640
This is basically what TLS Inspector does on iOS.

522
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,040
So you would know if a certain 
certificate is expired or is invalid.

523
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,960
This is how you make yourself 
a little bit more aware

524
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,480
about HTTPS and TLS security on Safari.

525
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,600
Because built-in Safari 
apparently does not have that.

526
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,240
And I'm a little bit icky about it

527
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,800
because there are some websites 
that are meant to be trustworthy.

528
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:27,200
Somebody in the tech department 
forgetting to update their certificates.

529
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,880
Okay, so with that said.

530
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,880
These are the five Safari 
extensions that I recommend.

531
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,200
So let's move on.

532
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,280
So for someone who likes 
to take some notes out of…

533
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,920
Say they want to take a quick note.

534
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,320
You know, back in those days, 
back in the old Hollywood times.

535
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,480
People always had these notepads in their hand

536
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,800
and they just quickly write a note

537
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,680
so that they can remind themselves in a moment.

538
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,320
How about we do that digitally?

539
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,840
So obviously you would have Apple 
Reminders and stuff like that.

540
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,400
However, what if I want to bring it 
cross-platform to elsewhere as well?

541
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
We're gonna keep that in mind most of the time.

542
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,160
So I've got some recommendations 
from fellow good Samaritans online

543
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,160
and also some parts of the iOS subreddit.

544
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,680
And most people recommended Joplin.

545
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,400
Joplin to me in first 
impressions kind of feels like

546
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,360
when you have Apple Reminders, 
Apple Notes, and Trello have a baby.

547
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,040
Which inherently is not 
really that bad in my opinion

548
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,600
because I am personally a Trello user.

549
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,200
That's how I've been reading my notes so far.

550
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,920
Though I don't have personal 
experience with Joplin.

551
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,400
But I'm looking forward to try it one day.

552
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,560
And I was told that Joplin 
allows you to backup your notes

553
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,240
in cloud services like Dropbox and so forth.

554
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,800
So I would be very much looking forward to that.

555
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,680
Hopefully it would optimize my experience.

556
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,040
Maybe it might not.

557
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,560
Who knows?

558
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,040
I'll update you in the future.

559
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,000
Now moving on.

560
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,520
This is where I'm gonna tell you 
to tread with extreme caution.

561
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,360
Because if you're very privacy conscious, 
you wouldn't want to use these.

562
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,040
So namely one of these is Google Keep.

563
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,960
Okay, I get it.

564
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,160
Reality check.

565
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,560
Google is interestingly "a kind of company".

566
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:12,040
But it is hard to deny that Google Keep has 
been really really useful for me so far.

567
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,920
But privacy wise, I wouldn't say 
it's necessarily that convenient.

568
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,760
So my best shot is if you are keeping quick notes

569
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,600
that are not really private or sensitive.

570
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,120
I guess Google Keep may just be fine.

571
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,320
But who knows one day Google 
might change their TOS and go,

572
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,000
"Oh we're gonna start reading your notes."

573
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Hopefully not.

574
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,160
Hopefully not.

575
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,240
And following that, we got another sketchy one

576
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,120
coming from Microsoft Sticky Notes.

577
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,640
Though the good part about 
using Microsoft Sticky Notes

578
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,200
is that you can put it on top 
of your screen on Windows.

579
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,000
And you can also do some changes 
on the OneNote app on iOS.

580
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,920
However, the synchronization 
is a bit wonky as hell

581
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,880
that sometimes the synchronization 
just do not work at all.

582
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,640
Sometimes I type something really 
really freaking long on my iPhone,

583
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,200
nothing left the phone.

584
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,640
Even though the app says it has.

585
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,360
Synchronization can be a bit janky here.

586
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,760
So I wouldn't recommend using that 
unless you are absolutely a Windows fan.

587
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,080
So tread with caution for those two programs.

588
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,200
Right, moving on.

589
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,600
Home Management.

590
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,720
It's Home Assistant.

591
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

592
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,040
I have nothing else to say.

593
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,160
Because if you want cross-platform, Home 
Assistant might be the best for you.

594
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,400
Though you could try out some other ones like say,

595
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,160
those that use Apple Home as their main platform.

596
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,720
But I still end up finding myself crawling 
my way back to Home Assistant instead.

597
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,600
Because although Home Assistant might 
be a little bit iOS unfriendly at times

598
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,840
because of the optimization that Apple 
imposes in their operating system.

599
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,240
It's still quite useful when it works.

600
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,160
And it didn't really fail on me too hard so 
I don't really see that much of a problem.

601
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,360
Right, moving on.

602
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,160
In terms of contact sync.

603
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,520
I don't really have experiences 
anywhere else outside

604
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:09,440
because I didn't really want to keep 
having a lot of point of management.

605
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,000
Especially when I'm managing 
this channel all by myself.

606
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,320
I have plenty of load on my shoulders already.

607
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,320
So I've basically just used Google Contact Sync.

608
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,200
However, for those privacy conscious 
people, you might want to stick around

609
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,640
a little bit to the end of the video for 
what you may be interested in looking.

610
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,200
So, moving on.

611
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,560
In terms of cameras, there 
really isn't any other camera app

612
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,440
that I really really like to use personally.

613
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,320
Aside from none other than ProShot.

614
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,880
ProShot basically makes you feel 
like you're handling a DSLR.

615
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,560
Because most of its features do feel 
kind of like a DSLR to some extent.

616
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,320
It's basically a DSLR in the form of an app.

617
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,240
Though of course the software 
capability is confined

618
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,840
within the hardware capability of your device.

619
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,880
So your mileage may vary significantly.

620
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,320
However, as an iPhone user, 
ProShot has been seriously

621
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,320
one of the amazing apps that gives 
you the amount of flexibility.

622
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,360
Like say you want it strictly on a certain 
aperture and a certain focal length.

623
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,120
And you want it at a certain 
zoom and a certain setting even.

624
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,080
Like frame rate settings and so forth.

625
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,680
All of that are available in this one app.

626
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
It's genuinely amazing.

627
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,880
Big camera energy.

628
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,680
Please don't tell a certain someone about this.

629
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,200
If you're a very enthusiastic photographer,

630
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,640
I highly recommend this app no matter what.

631
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,240
Though there may be some other things

632
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,240
that you might be interested in like 
filmography and stuff like that.

633
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,800
Then maybe Blackmagic camera might be your taste.

634
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,040
But ProShot is kind of like an 
all-in-one Apple camera killer.

635
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,680
So, big ups Rise Up Games.

636
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,520
Seriously, I've used it for so long.

637
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,680
Like I got this app close to a 
decade ago already at this point.

638
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,080
And they just keep growing and 
it just keeps getting better.

639
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,240
And I haven't really been pissed at them so far.

640
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,200
So, big ups.

641
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,360
Moving on.

642
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,040
When it comes to photo editing,

643
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,000
this might be a bit of a sticky 
situation to say the least.

644
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,880
I wouldn't recommend Photoshop Express 
because in my opinion, it just sucks.

645
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,160
Sorry to those who use Photoshop Express.

646
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:17,520
And many of the other apps just kind of are wonky

647
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,320
in the way that they put watermarks.

648
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,560
Or they put a limit to the 
resolution and stuff like that.

649
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,960
It genuinely pisses me off as a consumer.

650
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,960
Like a general consumer that 
have bought such a device

651
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,160
only to pay even more price premium*.

652
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,120
It's kind of like you've 
entered the most expensive place

653
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,240
only to pay for even more expensive 
stuff that you don't really need.

654
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,120
So with that, this might be a bit 
of a very, very harsh situation.

655
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,600
But if you're into Photoshop

656
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,200
and you still want all the 
features in Photoshop, Photopea.

657
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,360
So, Photopea is basically, well, legally 
distinct Photoshop to say the least.

658
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,880
And you can use them on your PC, you 
can use it on your mobile device.

659
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,600
But if you want to use it on 
your mobile device, however,

660
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,480
I highly recommend that you use 
it with a mouse or a stylus.

661
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,760
Either of which.

662
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,160
Because you might end up misclicking 
some stuff on the screen.

663
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,000
Considering how iPhone is kind of a 
small screen if you think about it.

664
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,040
But Photopea's functionality is more or less 
the same as the Adobe suite of programs*.

665
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,800
So, if you're looking to escape Adobe suite of 
programs, Photopea might be one of your choice.

666
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
That's really it for photo editing, honestly.

667
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,920
And last but not least, if 
you're into video editing

668
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,640
and you want the top of the class video editing.

669
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,720
And you want to break free from the 
Apple ecosystem, namely Logic Pro.

670
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,920
The only other solution for you is

671
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,520
if you happen to use iPads, then 
you would have DaVinci Resolve.

672
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,680
And DaVinci Resolve, interestingly, 
you can export and import

673
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,880
your projects back and forth between 
the computer version to the iPad.

674
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,200
Which is kind of freaking awesome.

675
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,160
So, say you were editing something 
really, really important.

676
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,780
And then suddenly, your 
entire family drags you out

677
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,640
because they accidentally 
bought your tickets to Hawaii.

678
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
But you still want to edit,

679
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,800
but you don't want to carry your 
bulky ass desktop or laptop.

680
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,040
But you got an iPad Pro, however,

681
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,120
DaVinci Resolve for iPad would 
be an amazing choice for you.

682
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,520
However, if you're on an iPhone,

683
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,320
DaVinci Resolve does not exist for the iPhone.

684
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,480
Which is really, really sad

685
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,320
because I kind of really wanted Blackmagic Design.

686
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,320
I hope you port it to the iOS as well.

687
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,520
Because I genuinely want to edit my videos

688
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,760
without worrying about 
completely different programs

689
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,840
when I'm on different platforms.

690
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,440
So, for the time being,

691
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,840
LumaFusion from LumaTouch is 
kind of like a backup for that.

692
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,720
It's available on iPadOS, 
it's available on iOS as well.

693
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,840
And as far as I've seen from 
all the reviews outside so far,

694
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,600
and the screenshots I've seen so far,

695
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,440
it kind of feels like DaVinci 
Resolve, but for iPhones.

696
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,160
So, though I have no personal 
experience with LumaFusion yet,

697
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,440
but I'm looking forward to buy it eventually.

698
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Please let me know of your experience 
of LumaFusion in the comments below.

699
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,320
And with that said, that's pretty much it

700
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,760
for all of my choices for alternative solutions.

701
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,320
Now, for those who have stuck around in 
this video that are very privacy conscious,

702
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,880
here's a page that I highly 
recommend you check out.

703
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,440
There's this page called Awesome Privacy,

704
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,120
and it is a very massive list 
for everything you need to know

705
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,400
about what you should avoid 
and what you should have

706
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,560
if you're very conscious of privacy.

707
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,520
Say for example, I'm interested in 
the two-factor authentication section.

708
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,320
Let's have a look.

709
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,400
Avoid using these apps that won't 
let you export your key easily,

710
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Authy and Google Authenticator.

711
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,120
However, there are some programs that

712
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,120
claims to have been able to 
import from Google Authenticator.

713
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,440
I don't know about that, but 
I guess that might be just

714
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,400
part of security vulnerabilities 
on Google Authenticator.

715
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,040
But hey, we got Ente over here, that's awesome.

716
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,160
I wish they have added 2FAS onto the list.

717
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,560
And there are plenty more.

718
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,680
Say Android app stores,

719
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,720
you have FDroid or Obtanium 
I would recommend personally.

720
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,800
Obtanium is basically just 
fetches straight from the source.

721
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,640
Like say, if you have someone's app 
that is directly hosted on GitHub

722
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,600
and FDroid and all the different places 
that are kind of like git focused,

723
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,880
you can use Obtanium to get app updates 
that way, which is kind of awesome.

724
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,360
Now say I want to look for mail services,

725
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,920
like say it would tell me to avoid 
Gmail, Outlook, Yandex and Yahoo.

726
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,880
And instead look for ForwardMail, 
ProtonMail, Tuta, Riseup and Mailfence.

727
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,880
And if you want to self-host yourself, 
these are the options over here.

728
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,160
And then you got clients for it as well.

729
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,120
K9, which is a pretty good, basically 
Mozilla Thunderbird, but Android?

730
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,000
It's made by Mozilla Foundation themselves.

731
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,400
I mean, not really made, they didn't create it.

732
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,320
They bought it and then they 
maintained it and so forth.

733
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,120
Kind of like that.

734
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,560
So you get the idea.

735
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,880
Awesome Privacy is a really 
awesome page to check out.

736
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,040
So I'll be linking it in the description below.

737
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,640
So please check it out.

738
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,240
And that is all I have for you today.

739
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,720
Thank you so much for watching.

740
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,920
And I hope you understand my thought process

741
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,400
for my choices of lists and stuff like that.

742
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,880
And if you do have your own suggestion

743
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,600
that you want to tell the other fellow 
commenters about it or lurkers about it,

744
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,200
please comment it down below and 
maybe let's discuss about it.

745
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,400
So it's been your girl, Mel.

746
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,640
And I hope to give more personal 
knowledge of mine to you.

747
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,983
And I'll see you guys on the next video.

748
00:37:24,983 --> 00:37:27,520
OtsuMelo deshita.
See ya!

749
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,120
According to WebMD, you have cancer.
