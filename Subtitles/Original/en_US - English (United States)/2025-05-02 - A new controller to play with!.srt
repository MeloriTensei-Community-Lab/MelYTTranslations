1
00:00:03,316 --> 00:00:05,930
Oh look, a new toy to mess around with.

2
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:08,520
Kon-Melo, it's ya Tech Wizardess girl, MeloriTensei.

3
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:12,270
And this right here is an 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller.

4
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:15,380
Now, I'm gonna make it clear that I've taken money out of my own pocket

5
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:18,820
and spent 0% of the donator's money on this thing.

6
00:00:18,816 --> 00:00:22,230
Primarily because I believe this should not be a donation goal

7
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:26,270
and rather more of something that I should take care of myself.

8
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:28,170
So let me set this scenario for you.

9
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,220
But first, we're gonna get this out of the way for now.

10
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:33,730
So if you've watched my live tab and watched me game on some games,

11
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,200
and you may notice that I'll be playing with a controller,

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,930
like particularly HoloCure and HoloXBreak,

13
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:43,670
then you might notice that I am playing with a very certain controller.

14
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:48,230
That's primarily because I'm playing with this PlayStation controller.

15
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,680
This right here is a PlayStation 4 controller,

16
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:54,780
particularly of the CUH-ZCT2G.

17
00:00:54,783 --> 00:00:58,250
While this controller has been a great service for me for 6 years straight,

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,700
unfortunately, there was a point of time where

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,830
the battery of this controller bloated.

20
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,620
And following that, the left stick starts drifting,

21
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:06,920
like dramatic drifting.

22
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,480
So like when I pushed forward,

23
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:13,850
what came out on the screen was a dramatic wiggling like this.

24
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,500
So I thought to myself,

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,430
maybe I should get to fixing it eventually.

26
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:22,430
So what I did is I scoured around in my inventory

27
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:24,200
to see if there's any spares.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,800
And sure enough, I do.

29
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,570
And this thing is the same model.

30
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:32,630
However, there's something a little different when I dismantled it.

31
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:33,920
A little more on that in a bit.

32
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:37,670
So what's so bad about this controller that prevents me from using it?

33
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:40,820
That's because I like the red color more than the black.

34
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:43,550
Like it's a lot more color vibrant.

35
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,530
There's a little more contrast to this, to the buttons, to the…

36
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,130
to the chassis.

37
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,530
And I'm kind of fond of this controller.

38
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:53,430
And also this little numbing is a little fucked.

39
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:55,630
Look at this disgusting piece of shit.

40
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:56,400
God damn it.

41
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,250
What have…

42
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,830
What have they done to you?

43
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,980
Or what have I done to you?

44
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:02,300
So I thought to myself,

45
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,350
well,

46
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:07,220
the potentiometer in the analog sticks here are not drifting.

47
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:12,720
And I don't want to spend money on soldering irons and learning how to solder and shit.

48
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,700
Primarily because I don't really have that much of that time.

49
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:21,080
And I don't really have much disposable income to mess around with these things just yet.

50
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,220
So if you would like to financially support me,

51
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:25,580
please check out my Ko-fi in the description below.

52
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,580
So I thought,

53
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,920
let's just do a board swap and the parts swap.

54
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:29,670
Maybe we could…

55
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,150
probably swap things here and there,

56
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,880
considering how these two are the same second generation controllers.

57
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:37,000
So swapping went really fine.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,830
It was pretty fine because a lot of things were really more or less the same.

59
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,530
Until I was about to close this controller.

60
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:45,120
So what I realized is that,

61
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:46,300
is that in this controller,

62
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,780
this red controller right here,

63
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:49,470
when upon closing it,

64
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:55,520
there was like two notches that goes right through the PCB of the controller.
(Within CUH-ZCT2 , there's varying model iterations.)

65
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:58,920
I didn't realize that was a thing because on this black controller,
(I couldn't find images for what I'm looking for.)

66
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,370
there wasn't a notch.

67
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:01,930
So when I moved that over,

68
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:04,980
I couldn't close it and I couldn't figure out for the life of me

69
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:06,520
for 20 whole minutes straight.

70
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:09,770
And after I saw some damages to the PCB,

71
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:14,130
well, fortunately, no cracks, just a little bit of white strain, I guess.

72
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:17,020
So when you strain the PCB, the plastic stretches a little,

73
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:18,620
that kind of white strain.

74
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,580
So when I saw a little markings over there,

75
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,730
I realized that,

76
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:26,850
oh, there was notches on the sides because this chassis has notches.

77
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:27,820
So,

78
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:29,950
with absolutely no choice,

79
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:31,020
I thought to myself,

80
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:32,570
let's just snip it off.

81
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:35,670
So I snipped it off and it closes kind of fine,

82
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,330
depending on who you talk to,

83
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,430
because for some people,

84
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:41,370
this gap is a little horrendous.

85
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,070
But hey,

86
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,200
it still clicks.

87
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,520
It doesn't drift and it plays just fine.

88
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,580
I'm not complaining.

89
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,150
However,

90
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,030
on the subject of controller drifts,

91
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:49,850
I thought to myself,

92
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:50,520
well,

93
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:53,480
both of these controllers are more or less the same age.

94
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,300
It's just one is a little more worn than the other.

95
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,850
So I thought,

96
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,550
I figured considering that they're potentiometers,

97
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:01,330
they might drift as well.

98
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,170
So I thought,

99
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,550
let's just have a complete reset of a new device.

100
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,770
So we won't have to worry about anything else,

101
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:12,780
like the already loose micro USB port in the back.

102
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:15,720
So I went to a place that is not AliExpress,

103
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:20,730
but if anything, similar to AliExpress and through my trusty suppliers,

104
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:24,370
I have procured myself an 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth controller.

105
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:26,930
The reason why I said "similar to AliExpress" is because

106
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:31,470
AliExpress has these things where you have coupons and shopping credits.

107
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:32,830
And in Asian markets,

108
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,280
they tend to have something like these a lot.

109
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:40,100
So I took advantage of the shopping credit system and grinded to living hell.

110
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,430
And I gotta be honest,

111
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:43,980
I may or may not be a psychopath

112
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:48,070
because I brought down the cost of this 8BitDo controller

113
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:53,150
down to the price of what you would get out of a 2C in MSRP.

114
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:54,230
You heard me right.

115
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:57,250
I bought this at the price of 2C.

116
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,580
So, I was pretty much banging on savings and...

117
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,000
I didn't lose too much money.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,370
So I guess that's a big W.

119
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:07,130
Right. What makes me pick this controller, however?

120
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,620
Well, a lot of the games are XInput compatible.

121
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:13,270
So I thought to myself, I don't have to deal with DS4Windows anymore.

122
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:17,520
And as for the layout, the Xbox layout versus the PlayStation layout,

123
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:20,950
despite being an Asian who is very used to the PlayStation layout,

124
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:22,050
I couldn't really care less

125
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,870
because I've actually played with an Xbox controller before,

126
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,450
particularly the Xbox One controller.

127
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,070
The one before the Bluetooth revision

128
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:33,980
So I think it was like 1709 or something like that.
(I was so god damn off)

129
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:34,980
17 something.

130
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:36,180
I don't quite remember.

131
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:38,930
It is the one before the Bluetooth.
(It is 1537)

132
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:42,370
So I was pretty accustomed to the Xbox layout regardless, nonetheless.

133
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:44,170
So I have less of that worry.

134
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:49,730
But what really sold me is the possible longevity because of these things.

135
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,520
These sticks are Hall effect,

136
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:57,380
which could mean that there is no friction and no direct contact

137
00:05:57,383 --> 00:06:02,880
to the receivers, which means there is little to no wear on the sticks,

138
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:05,270
which makes it last far longer.

139
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:07,120
This is definitely one of the selling points.

140
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:11,780
However, another one is particularly of it having Bluetooth.

141
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:17,530
So I'm the kind of person who likes to have things on compatible everything.

142
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,780
So like it has to be compatible with a phone.

143
00:06:19,783 --> 00:06:23,630
It has to be compatible with every other things that supports controller as well.

144
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,400
I don't like it to be single purposed.

145
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,650
Because of the money I paid for.

146
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,470
So there we have it.

147
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:35,300
And 2.4 is a big plus because this means lesser latency than Bluetooth.

148
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,070
So Yipee, I guess.

149
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:42,830
Well, USB, uh, I won't be using USB as much anyways,

150
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:47,170
but it can be good if we're running into radio interference.

151
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,280
Hey, that's a big plus.

152
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,330
Regardless, we got a charging dock.

153
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,330
That's just cool.

154
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:56,080
And out of the box, it has a Windows mode and Switch mode.

155
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,420
So Windows mode basically just means XInput.

156
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:06,450
So like A, B, X, Y, instead of what it currently shows on the picture, which is a Nintendo switch mode.

157
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,020
So on the print, it's going to be on switch by default,

158
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:14,870
but you can switch digitally those inputs through their Ultimate Software.

159
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:18,730
You can save this key binds into the memory as well.

160
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:22,220
So you won't have to deal with them ever again on other devices.

161
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:24,000
So that's a big plus 8BitDo.

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,280
So let's get right into it.

163
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:29,230
Ergh, it's a little hard to open it with gloves.

164
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:31,380
I gotta be honest.

165
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,650
Okay.

166
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:44,800
Ooh, it's got that slow release like Apple iPhones.

167
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,120
Ooh, check that out.

168
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:51,670
It's the controller itself.

169
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,580
What's that?

170
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,280
Oh, it's the dock.

171
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:54,200
No, my bad.

172
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,420
I'm sorry.

173
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,070
I completely forgot about that.

174
00:07:57,066 --> 00:08:00,070
Let's get the controller out of the way first.

175
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,770
We'll get to you in a moment.

176
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:06,500
And right here we have a charging dock.

177
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Wha- I wonder what's it's power rating.

178
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,980
I'll figure it out later because this might be a bit of a concern for myself

179
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:18,430
because I have a USB hub that is powered, but I'm not sure how much power it needs.

180
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:23,350
Right here we got the owner's manual, a type A to type C cable.

181
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,370
All right, let's open up the manuals real quick.

182
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:34,400
Oh no.

183
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,980
This is that type of manual that a certain YouTuber hates.

184
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:39,800
Wade: Oh no.
(The Certain YouTuber)

185
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,980
Wade: Is this a roadmap?

186
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:42,430
Wade: Oh no.

187
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,350
Wade: (Wheeze) Ha, ha ha ha, ha!

188
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,370
Wade: I loathe these manuals! Heheh.

189
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:47,870
Wade: Where do I begin?!

190
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:49,280
How am I supposed to read this on camera?

191
00:08:49,283 --> 00:08:50,230
What the heck?

192
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:53,800
You know what? I'm just going to show you screenshots of that in a PDF.

193
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,570
Switch system needs to be 3.0.0 or above.

194
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:02,930
NFC scanning, IR camera, HD rumble, notification LED are not supported.

195
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:03,630
Okay.

196
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,530
Not, not of my concern because I don't have a Nintendo Switch.

197
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:07,600
[Bluetooth connection.]

198
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,880
Hold the pair button for three seconds to enter its pairing mode.

199
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,970
LED starts to blink rapidly.

200
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,380
This is required for the very first time only.

201
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:17,630
Then go to your Switch homepage, click on controllers,

202
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,650
then click on change grip/order.

203
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,030
Status LED becomes solid when the connection is successful.

204
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:24,150
[Wireless connection.]

205
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,400
OTG cable is required for the Switch Lite.

206
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,230
Oh, never heard of something like this for the Switch Lite.

207
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:33,030
Oh wait, I'm looking at the Switch section.

208
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:37,120
So if I go down here, there's a, there's a Windows section.

209
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:41,580
Requires system Windows 10 1903 or above.

210
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,450
Okay.

211
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,650
Connect the receiver.

212
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,180
Turn on the mode.

213
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:47,120
Press the home button to turn on the controller.

214
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:51,020
Wait till the controller is successfully recognized by your Windows device to play.

215
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:52,020
[Turbo function.]

216
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:55,720
Star button equals the screenshot by default when it's connected to the Switch.

217
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:58,770
You can change this in the 8BitDo Ultimate software.

218
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:02,780
Wonder what the turbo of the button really does aside from that on the Windows mode.

219
00:10:02,783 --> 00:10:04,070
[Battery indicator.]

220
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:09,320
22 hours of play time with 1000 milliamp built-in battery pack.

221
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:12,370
Rechargeable with two to three hours of charging time.

222
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:14,620
Low battery - Red LED blinks.

223
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:16,650
Charging - Red stays solid.

224
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,670
Fully charged - Red turns off.

225
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,300
[Charging dock status.]

226
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:21,820
White is charging.

227
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:23,080
White solid is charging.

228
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,830
Fully charged - White is off.

229
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,770
Charging time with the controller on the dock is the same as charging via USB cable.

230
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:29,470
I see.

231
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:30,280
[Ultimate software.]

232
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:33,570
Press the profile switch button to switch between three profiles.

233
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,230
The profile indicator will not light up using default setting.

234
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:40,530
It gives you elite control over every piece of controller.

235
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:41,850
Customize button mapping.

236
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,870
Adjust stick and trigger sensitivity.

237
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:45,220
Vibration control.

238
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:47,400
And create micros with any button combination.

239
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,700
Please visit support.8BitDo.com for the application.

240
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,050
All right.

241
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:53,680
I'll look into that in a moment.

242
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:54,480
First up.

243
00:10:54,483 --> 00:10:56,280
I need to get this out of the way.

244
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:58,100
This is a nightmare.

245
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,270
Like behind the camera.

246
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:04,820
I am suffering trying to not ruin this user's manual

247
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:07,330
because of how difficult it is to try to fold it back up,

248
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,930
especially how large it is.

249
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,100
Let's have a look at the dock.

250
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,080
But first we could get this out of the way.

251
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:16,230
So we got the dock with its protective film in there.

252
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:19,120
Okay.

253
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:23,370
We got three prongs and a USB-C port behind.

254
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:24,730
There's a little hatch down here.

255
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,280
Let's have a look.

256
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:26,980
Oh, wow.

257
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:28,120
That is ingenious.

258
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:28,780
I like that.

259
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:30,580
They put the dongle in there

260
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,270
so you don't have to waste another space in the plastic for that.

261
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:39,930
Except it's a little difficult for someone with a pair of gloves.

262
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,120
I've got to use my fingernail for this.

263
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:44,170
Oh, this is bad.

264
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,120
There we go.

265
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:47,200
How adorable.

266
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,930
The thing looks like brick.

267
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:51,570
So you could not only just plug it to a USB hub.

268
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:53,550
You could also put it in the dock.

269
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:55,470
So, it would become a receiver itself.

270
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:59,070
So that means theoretically there's a USB passthrough in the dock

271
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:02,150
while it does the charging at the same time, which is kind of awesome.

272
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:02,630
I got to be honest.

273
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:04,300
So we're going to keep that in there

274
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:08,300
or no, we're going to keep it out because I'm not planning to use the dock just yet.

275
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:11,420
I'm still thinking of a perfect spot to put the dock.

276
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,270
So we'll take care of that later.

277
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,220
Right, let's have a look at the back.

278
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:16,720
See what I got here.

279
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:21,880
It may be a little difficult to see, but it says 8BitDo charging dock for Ultimate Controllers.

280
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:27,670
Input DC 5 volts, 0.5 amps or 500 miliamps.

281
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,470
So it takes half an amp.

282
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,350
So that's interesting.

283
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,600
And in theory, it should not have issues with my charging hub then.

284
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,730
Right.

285
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:41,670
Let's get that out of the way and enter the big guy.

286
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,420
Right, let's get into this.

287
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,300
Ooh.

288
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,430
Clean looking.

289
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:53,870
You know, the entire build kind of reminds me the reminiscent to some Xbox controllers,

290
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:57,470
like a more modern third party Xbox controllers.

291
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:59,070
And it's pretty much that.

292
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:03,700
It has the weight of it, the feel of it, just not the stick of it.

293
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,070
The stick feels more like it dimples outwards instead of dips in,

294
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:11,680
which is what usually Xbox first party controllers are like.

295
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:14,800
The buttons feel really solid.

296
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,300
If anything, a little more...

297
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:21,330
thocky than clicky compared to the Xbox One controller.

298
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,820
It's more thocky.

299
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:31,300
Oh, there's a there's a little more deeper thock on the stick click than the Xbox controller as well.

300
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:33,370
In case you're wondering what's with the slimy sounds,

301
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:37,320
that's primarily just because we still got the protective film for the face buttons.

302
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,570
I'm not planning to take that off.

303
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:40,880
Screw you, Linus.

304
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:43,270
I'm not a peeler.

305
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:47,630
I'll, I'll only peel it off when it comes off naturally.

306
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:49,120
I gotta be honest.

307
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:52,130
The click of this is a little more.

308
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:57,170
Well, it still has the high notes of the Xbox controller,

309
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:01,720
but with a little hint of deep thock, which is interesting.

310
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:06,800
So there's an LED, there's a USB and this assumes to be a pair button.

311
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,270
But what are these two notches for?

312
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,200
I wonder.

313
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,120
Okay.

314
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:15,650
The minus, star and the plus button are very solid.

315
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:19,100
It has this high note of click, clickery.

316
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,720
It feels really satisfying, really solid.

317
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:23,570
It doesn't feel sluggish.

318
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:28,220
So, like, even if you try to press on the edge, it feels more center balanced.

319
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:32,280
I wouldn't call it stabilized because it's not there yet, but it's almost there.

320
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:40,270
The stick hitting the chassis sounds deep in the sense that it feels like the PlayStation 4 controller.

321
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:42,130
I've not experienced with the DualSense yet,

322
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:45,630
so I can't really judge with DualSense in comparison.

323
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,550
Right...

324
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:50,420
Ooh, I'm constantly pressing these two buttons in the back.

325
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:54,920
There are two buttons that were called "Pro buttons" or something like that by them.

326
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:59,530
It feels like a general button, like a low profile button that you would click.

327
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,180
But you might end up accidentally misclicking into it

328
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:05,070
because of the because of the existence of those buttons.

329
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:08,750
If you're someone of a gripper like me, that might be a slight problem

330
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,330
and you might want to rebind those somewhere else or maybe just unbind it outright.

331
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,820
But I'll think about it.

332
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:16,480
Oh, okay.

333
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,620
This is where it kind of fell off a bit.

334
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:19,870
Let me just let me have you here.

335
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:21,200
This like this.

336
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,870
This is a little...

337
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:26,780
Yeah um, the shoulder buttons are a little bit sloppy.

338
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:27,600
It was fine.

339
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,980
It was solid overall, but the shoulder buttons were a little weird sounding.

340
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:35,620
But then when you get to the trigger buttons, it feels solid again.

341
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:39,450
So what went wrong on the shoulder buttons, I wonder?

342
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,570
We'll see.

343
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:45,530
Okay, let's connect the controller and let's see what we have to deal with.

344
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,350
ERGH!

345
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,030
Right, sitting right here and from a distance,

346
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:55,000
I could see blue flashing LEDs and I can't really tell what they are.

347
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,800
It looks interesting, though.

348
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,130
We did get a new device indication.

349
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:01,130
So let's find out what they are.

350
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,920
Okay, so I found absolutely nothing.

351
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:07,030
Well, it's pretty obvious because the controller is not even on to begin with.

352
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,480
So let's turn it on.

353
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:15,950
Oh, that sounds interesting to me.

354
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,420
Let's have a double look.

355
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:20,230
Oh, would you look at that?

356
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:23,070
An Xbox 360 controller for Windows.

357
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,570
So they are using hardware level emulation?

358
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:27,830
It seems like it.

359
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:33,920
It seems like it that it's happening on the hardware level on the USB stick itself.

360
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,500
The adapter or something like that,

361
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,220
especially when you hear a disconnection, then a reconnection immediately after.

362
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:40,300
I think that might be the case.

363
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,970
Honestly, that sounds interesting.

364
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:46,680
Oh, surprisingly, it recognizes the name of the controller properly as well.

365
00:16:46,683 --> 00:16:49,780
Okay, let's have a look.

366
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:55,420
Okay, the axis, stick.

367
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,800
It looks pretty circular.

368
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,570
I got to be honest.

369
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:02,020
What about this end?

370
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:05,050
Well, I can't tell about that one.

371
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:08,170
Then all the buttons.

372
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:11,130
Wonder what the middle star button actually does.

373
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:14,350
'Coz it doesn't flash around here.

374
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:21,000
Point of view hat, okay.

375
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,550
Face buttons.

376
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:32,750
The rear buttons don't do a thing either.

377
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:33,980
Okay.

378
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:36,520
Let's see what else can we get out of this thing?

379
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:39,970
Okay, so I have went up to Hardware Tester

380
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:44,220
on this gamepad tester page to see how this is like.

381
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:48,380
So, interestingly, they have emulated pretty much everything.

382
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:54,220
And the buttons are pretty much as binaryly digital as they can.

383
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:56,150
And then a couple of analog.

384
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,850
I did see a little bit of, like if you look at where the dot is at,

385
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:06,770
it's going in and out, waving in and out a little bit as I was going around the circle.

386
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,500
Same could be said here as well.

387
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,850
So I think there might be a bit of room of error here.

388
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:12,870
But, yeah.

389
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:16,300
But we'll see about the errors in a moment.

390
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,350
Okay.

391
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:19,550
Right, let's do a circularity test.

392
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,620
Spin joystick slowly to test.

393
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:22,750
Here we go.

394
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,120
I'm gonna make sure that it doesn't slip out of my hand.

395
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:28,720
Especially I'm wearing a glove.

396
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:31,650
Let's have a second pass.

397
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:37,480
Just to make sure that the errors we're seeing are consistent.

398
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:43,000
Right, let's do the other one.

399
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,100
Woah.

400
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:52,070
Oh, that's a pretty high number.

401
00:18:52,316 --> 00:18:53,320
Oh, never mind.

402
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:55,150
It solved itself.

403
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,500
Ah, that looks very consistent.

404
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,880
So guys, if you think this is okay, please let me know in the comments below.

405
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:06,120
I'm not too familiar with the circularity test and what parameters are the best.

406
00:19:06,116 --> 00:19:10,670
But if you think this is awesome or good, please let me know.

407
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,350
I'm not too sure if 8.1 is a good or a bad just yet.

408
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:16,770
But I gotta be honest, just looking at the chart alone,

409
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:18,100
it looks very consistent.

410
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:21,620
It looked like it's pretty much expected out of factory.

411
00:19:21,616 --> 00:19:22,350
Right.

412
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:24,120
We got more things to mess around with.

413
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:26,570
So let's head on to 8BitDo's website.

414
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,100
Oh, hey, it's the Ultimate 2C.

415
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:29,850
What an irony.

416
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:32,070
And we head down to support.

417
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:36,700
And supposedly, according to instructions, we're supposed to get the Ultimate software

418
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,800
right here.

419
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:42,430
And presumably it wants us to state which controller we're using.

420
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:45,150
So, in this case, it will be the ultimate Bluetooth controller.

421
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,950
8BitDo Ultimate Software.

422
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,650
Available on Windows, Google Play, and iOS App Store.

423
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay, that's pretty cool.

424
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,800
Can I do the configuration for the controller with the 8BitDo Ultimate software on PC when

425
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:56,870
it's on Bluetooth connection?

426
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:57,370
No, you can't.

427
00:19:57,366 --> 00:20:01,200
You can only do it for the controller with 8BitDo Ultimate software on PC

428
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,520
when it's on 2.4 wireless or wired.

429
00:20:04,516 --> 00:20:06,300
What does the star button do on a controller?

430
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:10,150
The star button is for turbo activation button on the default setting.

431
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,170
You can change the function to auto,

432
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:16,300
Swap buttons or remap it to other buttons on the controller. Huh.

433
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,820
How many groups of custom profiles can be saved in the controller?

434
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:23,120
It can be saved three groups of custom profile for each connection mode.

435
00:20:23,116 --> 00:20:25,350
Okay, that sounds interesting.

436
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,400
Now I'm going to insert a little bit piece of information here.

437
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,850
I've actually opened this controller beforehand to do some testings for warranty purposes.

438
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,950
And I've also found that

439
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,120
while you can't configure the controller in Bluetooth mode for PC,

440
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,870
you can however do it on the mobile through Bluetooth mode.

441
00:20:45,866 --> 00:20:50,520
So I think they should clarify on that a little bit.

442
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,380
But regardless, let's continue with that.

443
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:56,380
So I have not experience on the Windows side, the PC side,

444
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:58,620
but I have experience on the mobile side.

445
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:00,950
But I'm not going to talk too much about that just yet.

446
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,670
Let's download the software real quick.

447
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:10,330
And oh boy, what is this 8BitDo Ultimate software?

448
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,030
Oh, oh, that's an interesting sound.

449
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:17,170
And also it doesn't install.

450
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,470
It just runs portable.

451
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:21,030
Okay, interesting.

452
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:24,700
That's actually pretty good for people who want to carry the software around with them.

453
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,320
That's big props for you, 8BitDo.

454
00:21:26,316 --> 00:21:27,300
Holy crap.

455
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,400
Right, so we're going to go to Windows mode, I guess.

456
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,580
So as you can see, I have already set my first profile to be called Xbox.

457
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,500
And that's pretty much it actually.

458
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,320
But you could save way more profiles so you can try to mess around with other profiles

459
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:41,350
while you're at it.

460
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:44,220
And you can still do your test right here,

461
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:47,870
like as in how much you want to set for the dead zones and stuff like that,

462
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:50,500
followed by the same thing you could do with the triggers as well.

463
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,370
And as for how much in vibration you liked it to be.

464
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:57,750
So according to the imagery, the big vibrator is on the left

465
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,020
and the smaller ones on the right.

466
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:01,330
So like the lighter one.

467
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,870
And you can set some macros, which I got to be honest, is a pretty cool idea, but I'll

468
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,780
need a lot more time to actually get used to macros

469
00:22:07,783 --> 00:22:10,020
if I want to set some macros for some other games.

470
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:13,950
Because I've lived a society of no macro for a very, very long time,

471
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,300
so I can't really say much about that.

472
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:20,370
But this is where you change the controls and you will see that that B has been set

473
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:25,550
to A just like an Xbox because naturally it's A, B, X, Y for controller,

474
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:29,780
whereas it's, it's a Y, X, B, A for, for switch.

475
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:32,500
So it holds, so it's a whole different story, I guess.

476
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,420
But regardless, I won't really be looking at the, at the face buttons as much anyways.

477
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,000
So I think it's not too big of an issue.

478
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,580
However, I kind of do wish that 8BitDo gives us an option to

479
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,430
probably remove, pop off the front plate-

480
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:51,180
face plate, and maybe swap the sides, you know, for, for the A, B, X, Y to give it more

481
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:56,520
Xbox default front facing, especially when it does XInput for PCs.

482
00:22:56,516 --> 00:22:58,420
But I think that's a pretty good touch.

483
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,030
Do you want to change to a different platform?

484
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:00,650
Yes.

485
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,520
So this is for the switch mode.

486
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:06,130
And as you can see, I have also preset two different profiles.

487
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:09,700
So we got the Xbox profile and then we got the switch profile.

488
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,100
So in case you're wondering.

489
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:15,830
What's with the Xbox profile in switch mode, that's primarily because here's a little downside.

490
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:19,600
Um, I read this up on an article and I'm going to put it on screen right here.

491
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,430
That XInput only works on wired and 2.4 wireless.

492
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:27,950
So if you want to play on Bluetooth, it would be in switch mode,

493
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,200
which means the buttons are swapped.

494
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
So if you want to bring back the Xbox mapping,

495
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,080
you would have to save it in the profile with those changed back to the usual Xbox.

496
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,130
But it's nothing that we can't do.

497
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:42,070
As long as the software is still around

498
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:44,500
and it doesn't rely on being online.

499
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,230
I think it would be perfectly fine.

500
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:52,670
The same could be said for a very specific motherfucker of my tech household.

501
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:55,400
Welcome back Galaxy Note 10+.

502
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,870
So before we take care of that, let's gracefully turn off the software and everything,

503
00:23:59,866 --> 00:24:01,650
but we're going to have a good look at this.

504
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,750
Controller firmware v1.0.3.

505
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,870
You can do device tests.

506
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:06,120
That sounds interesting.

507
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:06,950
Oh, okay.

508
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,270
So that's how it means. Okay.

509
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:10,100
So you can see the buttons.

510
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:11,050
Oh, you can't see.

511
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,400
You can't see if it registers the back buttons.

512
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,920
A bit though.

513
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,170
I think you're missing something a little, you know?

514
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,800
Oh, you need to press the triggers for it to show up.

515
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,520
But even so it's not registering.

516
00:24:20,516 --> 00:24:22,170
Maybe it's because I'm on the switch mode.

517
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:25,220
So let's swap back to the Xbox mode.

518
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:26,120
Oh, there we go.

519
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:28,400
And the face buttons behave correctly as well.

520
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,330
Okay.

521
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,180
Interesting.

522
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:31,980
Right.

523
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:35,250
Oh, you can calibrate the device and reset the factory settings,

524
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,980
which I'm not planning to do so.

525
00:24:36,983 --> 00:24:38,870
You can also get beta builds.

526
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:39,630
That's interesting.

527
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:42,880
You can do beta firmware updates or something like that.

528
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:48,000
That sounds interesting, but good to see that 8BitDo has done quite an effort to,

529
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,680
to make it very, very usable.

530
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:52,000
So I'm proud of you, 8BitDo.

531
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,270
Right.

532
00:24:52,266 --> 00:24:54,120
Let's get onto the Bluetooth part of things.

533
00:24:54,116 --> 00:24:56,130
But first, how do we turn this off?

534
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:58,920
Do we press and hold this button?

535
00:25:00,283 --> 00:25:04,000
Oh, pressing and holding turns it off.

536
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,770
Good to see.

537
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:07,880
The same could be said for the PlayStation 4 controller,

538
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:10,430
but you have to press it for a whole lot longer.

539
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:11,080
Right.

540
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,820
Let's get onto the Bluetooth mode.

541
00:25:12,816 --> 00:25:17,620
But first we gotta unplug the 2.4 wireless though.

542
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,980
We don't want some accidentals.

543
00:25:20,983 --> 00:25:21,730
Right.

544
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:27,720
So to switch to Bluetooth mode in the back, you would see two different switches.

545
00:25:27,716 --> 00:25:32,050
One's got a icon of a Bluetooth, another that just says 2.4G.

546
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:34,930
So what do you have to do is just switch them like this.

547
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,830
Just flick the toggle and now it's on Bluetooth mode.

548
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:42,480
Now currently it's paired to my daily driving iPhone,

549
00:25:42,483 --> 00:25:47,720
but instead what I would like to do is to re-pair it to this beauty of a phone

550
00:25:47,716 --> 00:25:50,150
that is known as the Galaxy Note 10 Plus.

551
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,080
First up, we get to Bluetooth mode and I'm going to turn the controller on.

552
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,950
By default, it would be searching for a device, but so to, to re-pair it,

553
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,900
we press and hold the pair button.

554
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:04,470
So it starts flashing like this.

555
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:09,780
And now we just have to go to pair new device and we'll find a Pro controller.

556
00:26:12,183 --> 00:26:14,980
And once you're done pairing, we're off to the races.

557
00:26:14,983 --> 00:26:16,930
It works out of the box.

558
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:17,720
Right.

559
00:26:17,716 --> 00:26:20,480
There is one more thing we still have to take care of.

560
00:26:20,483 --> 00:26:23,470
We gotta install the 8BitDo Ultimate Software.

561
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:27,820
Allow the Ultimate Software to find and connect to relative position of nearby devices.

562
00:26:27,816 --> 00:26:32,870
This would be necessary to get the device into configuration mode of some sort.

563
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:35,870
Click to use the 8BitDo Ultimate Software.

564
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:37,470
Well, it's flashing now.

565
00:26:37,466 --> 00:26:40,170
I wonder if it's actually doing the job.

566
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,600
You mean click the screen?

567
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,430
Oh, oh, oh, we're in.

568
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:48,870
So it's the same as the PC counterpart, it's asking us Windows and switch.

569
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:51,420
Oh, there's button mapping and more settings.

570
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:53,970
Yeah, it visually looks more or less the same.

571
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:56,330
I gotta be honest.

572
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,030
I can't really complain much about that.

573
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,780
It's pretty good, actually.

574
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:03,320
Yeah, feels more or less the same as the PC counterpart.

575
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:03,870
But just more.

576
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:05,170
More portable, I guess.

577
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,970
Well, good to see about that.

578
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:09,580
Right, let's try out Zenless Zone Zero.

579
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:12,670
Let's see how well it performs with this controller.

580
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:15,130
Maybe I have to switch that manually.

581
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,680
Oh, we got controller mode.

582
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:19,970
There we go.

583
00:27:19,966 --> 00:27:25,800
So as you can see, I'm currently on profile one, which is my self-set Xbox profile.

584
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:30,370
So it's behaving like an Xbox controller somehow in terms of button mapping wise.

585
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:35,180
Let's try getting into the battle and see how comfortable it is to play with it.

586
00:27:35,183 --> 00:27:37,750
Alright, so I'm gonna pick this...

587
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,520
Yep, this one.

588
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:39,970
I'm gonna grind this one.

589
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:43,200
And away we go.

590
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,320
Let's see.

591
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:55,670
Well, my phone's a little laggy, but to be fair, it's a really old phone,

592
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:58,480
so I can't really say much about it.

593
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:06,100
but hey, at least the phone's playable, right?

594
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,920
Ey, not bad.

595
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:16,880
I gotta say, it's a pretty pleasant experience so far.

596
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:22,230
Albeit a little bit sticky because of the protective film I'm intentionally leaving on here.

597
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,930
But I gotta be honest, nice click, nice feel to the touch.

598
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:27,170
It feels really nice.

599
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:32,850
And it's got that satisfying tactile feeling that is, if anything,

600
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:40,200
a little bit better than all the previous controllers in the past, like the Xbox 360 and probably

601
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,920
even the Xbox One controller I currently have.

602
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:44,030
Even that one as well.

603
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:46,970
So I think this one's like an upgrade to me at this point.

604
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:52,330
It feels like an Xbox One controller and the PlayStation 4 controller had a baby,

605
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,170
and then this is what it came up to.

606
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:59,500
A very decent Bluetooth friendly yet Xbox, or even cross-platform actually,

607
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,230
controller that does everything.

608
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:04,800
So I think it's kind of a worthwhile upgrade for me

609
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,630
that kind of replaces both my Xbox

610
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:10,350
and PlayStation controllers.

611
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:13,030
So yea with that said, I'm just gonna wrap it all up right now.

612
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:18,630

616
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:30,670
which is kind of awesome.

617
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:31,780
I'm kind of looking forward to this.

618
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:34,070
I'm getting really, really close to monetization.

619
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:37,030
I hope YouTube would approve my application by then.

620
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,170
But for now, fingers crossed.

621
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:42,900
And I hope for a better future for the channel.

622
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,530
With that said, that's it.

623
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,000
OtsuMelo deshita (It's been ya girl Mel).

624
