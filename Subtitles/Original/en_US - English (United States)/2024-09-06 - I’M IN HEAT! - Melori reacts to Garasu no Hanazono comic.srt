00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:15,460
OG Love Live! fans, tell me you know this meme!

6
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:18,690
Tell me you know that reference earlier.

7
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,300
Oh shoot, dang it.

roger_von: Is is the one with the
"Motto motto motto" looping?

9
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,260
No, not that one.

10
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:28,830
Phoenix_Rain: Is  the meme you're talking about
Chika yelling about everyone wanting to shine?

11
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,830
Yeah, where she gone super saiyan.

12
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,890
That meme where she gone super saiyan.

Just kept going until that (stutters) brief guitar moment.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,450
That meme, it was just so hilarious.

17
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:55,580
Phoenix: I never saw-
Mel: Hold on!

18
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,010

And then Ruby got a moment of just playing the guitar.

33
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,610
Yeah, I know right. That was the greatest meme I've ever enjoyed

34
00:01:50,616 --> 00:01:52,750
coming from this song.

35
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,750

into a YT video

37
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,650
with that Nozomi and Eli song.

38
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,400
Phoenix: I got a kick out of that, hahahah.

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,560
Wait, what? What do you mean by that?

40
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:08,710
Wait what?
roger_von: Was it the "Gay or European"?

41
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:12,530
Wait, what? (laughs) What?

Ahh, that felt awfully familiar by that thumbnail though, holy.

43

Right...

00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:48,210
Ah?

00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,330
(Eli & Nozomi - Garasu no Hanazono / Garden of Glass suddenly plays)
Wah oh! Oh that's so...

47
00:02:56,333 --> 00:03:00,330

Oh, god. (Breathes heavily)

73
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:45,780
God, I love yu- I love yuri contexts a lot

74
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:51,180
and this is just top notch. (breathes in) Wah!

75
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:58,890
Hwah!

76
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:04,710
Wah!

78
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:21,300
I thought- (laughs)

79
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:29,960
(loses breath) (laughs even more)

80

Oh my god, I'm a-

94
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:41,500
As a Yuri lover, this makes me wiggle so god damn much.

95
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:46,660
I don't care all the content is. It's the story that matters.

96
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,260
*Yuri panic*

97
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,210
I'm so sorry.

98
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:53,060
I'm going really nuts right now.

99
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:55,050
(excitement)

100
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,190
Okay

101
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,390
(Breathes)

102
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,560
You know what, you know what, no. I'm-

103
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:05,380
Save, create new playlist, private playlist.

104
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:12,430
"Absolute masterpiece"

105
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:18,060
(laughs)

106
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:22,960
You know what, you're making me want to play this song right now.

107
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:27,730
Let's go, let's fucking go.

108
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:30,510
Where is it? [Ga]... (searching)

109
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:33,450
Garasu no Hanazono doko?
(Where is the "Garden of Glass"?)

110
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,410
Doko, doko, doko...

111
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:40,460
I'm going really really slow, in hopes that I'll be able to see it.

112
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:44,380
Garasu no Hanazono
(Garden of Glass)

113
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:46,460
Yep, I- (stutters)

114
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:50,080
My eyes was kind of blind for a second. Heheh.

115
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,630
I had to double-check the YouTube video because

116
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:56,540
the YouTube video had a content ID detection so

117
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:59,000
I could see the spelling of the name there.

118
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,790
Hold on.

119
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,930
I want to create a brand new team and just

120
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:04,980
"Sort by", "Âµ's"

121
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:06,860
Oh wait, there's another Nozomi here.

122
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:08,460
Oh, there's another Eli here.

123
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:11,100
(laughs)

124
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,160
Oh, there's another Eli!

125
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,290
(laughs loudly)

126
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,910
We're slowly going to form a lesbian team at this point, holy fuck.

127
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,410
Oh, there's another Nozomi right here!

128
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,980
Is there any other Nozomi?

129
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:27,160
Any- There is!

130
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:31,010
(More laughs)

131
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:33,760
Phoenix: Oh my, what switch have I set off?
(laughs)

132
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:36,260
Oh, there's another Eli!

133
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,630
Come on, one more Eli, one more Eli.

134
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:43,630
Just one more Eli, damn it! There is...

135
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:48,260
We're just one Eli off, we're just missing one Eli.

136
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:51,560
(screams in agony)

137
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:53,960
(laughs)

138
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:58,930
Is it alright if I put someone random to fill up the space?

139
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,350
Who do you think I should put, who do you think I should put?

140
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,350
Nico, right.

141
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,450
Hehehe, here we go.

142
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,460
(Breathes in then laughs) Oh my god.

143
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:14,910
Wait, hold on. I got a- I got a funny idea. Hold on.

144
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,780
We're gonna swap positions between this two.

145
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:21,010
Swap this and...

146
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:25,260
Where's the other... swap this.

147
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,450
Ey, look at that!

148
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,080
We got- heheheh.

149
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:32,730
We got Eli surrounded by two SR Nozomis

150
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:38,760
(laughs)

151
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:41,610
Oh my god. (laughs)

152
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:44,610
What if I started? Hehe.

153
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:46,130
(calms down)

154
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:49,060
Oh my god, let's go!

155
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:53,160
Well better, we surrounded Eli.

156
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,360
Hehe.

157
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:57,630
I'm laughing so much.

158
00:10:57,633 --> 00:11:00,450
My hands are not gonna be focusing at all.

159
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,790
This is bad.

160
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:05,610
Oh shoot.

161
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:08,630
Nope, we're restarting, we're restarting, we're restarting.

162
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:11,680
There's no way I'm letting this off.

163
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:15,790
Oh, what the shoot?

164
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,880
Oh shoot, dang it.

165
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:22,610
Ahhhhhh, okay.

166
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,280
(Slaps face)

167
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,140
Okay.

168
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,700
Relax, my hand is shaking right now.

169
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,380
My hand is like shivering.

170
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:31,580
Heh.

171
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,430
Let's go.

172
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:54,310
Holy crap

173
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:29,010
Let's go

174
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,850
We got it.

175
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,660
Oh, that was pain.

176
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:37,080
That was painful.

177
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:45,200
(calms down)

178
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,760
We got it, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it.

179
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,010
Oh my god.

180
00:13:52,283 --> 00:13:54,040
That meme was good, seriously.

181
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,830
I mean, not meme. That animation.

182
