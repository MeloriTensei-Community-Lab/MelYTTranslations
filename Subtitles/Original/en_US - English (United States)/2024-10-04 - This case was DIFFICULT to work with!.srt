1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,710
So, I bought a case from China.

2
00:00:02,716 --> 00:00:05,660
I got it from AliExpress for similar price as this.
(8.20-13.50USD per piece)

3
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:08,380
But filming with this case was a NIGHTMARE

4
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,330
I hope you enjoy me losing my mind over this.

5
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,250
I'm finally building a PC!

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,300
That's right, in case you're wondering, why am I suddenly building a PC?

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,130
Well, technically I don't really know myself either,

8
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:24,890
but MamaMelori decided to switch to PC gang.

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,760
Yeah!

10
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:32,160
That means I get to build a really decent custom desktop

11
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,540
that would be a great introductory for her.

12
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:40,250
Now, I want to preface this that the choice of parts are very, very particular,

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,000
and I'm going to explain through it very thoroughly as we build this PC.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,680
So let's get straight into it.

15
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:49,210
So I'm going to start off with, well,

16
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,580
introducing the case,

17
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:56,260
because I can't really say much about this PC without talking about the case.

18
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,350
Oh, it's too big for the frame, innit?

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,110
It's the ZUOOS…

20
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:04,630
Whatever this is called.

21
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:08,730
So this thing is a micro ATX case.

22
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:13,260
Yes, it's maximum size is only micro ATX.

23
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:19,730
That means if I were to build a PC with ATX size only, that case is not going to work.

24
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:21,410
Now, to explain the reason why,

25
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:24,150
that's because my mom has a really, really small desk,

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,360
and the market that I am in is not particularly friendly to ITX builds.

27
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:35,110
So that means the smallest I can build personally is only MATX.

28
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:36,530
But that's perfectly fine,

29
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:42,380
because we're going to get into another argument that leads to the same point,

30
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:45,480
but you'll see why.

31
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:50,450
Now, to explain why am I going with this abomination of a motherboard,

32
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,380
and not go for something like MSI or Asus,

33
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:58,710
well, it's mainly budget reasons.

34
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:01,040
Well, underneath here, we got all the usual stuff.

35
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,290
We got the Wi-Fi antenna,

36
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,780
a SATA cable, which we'll never use,

37
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:09,310
and an I.O. shield, which we will use.

38
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:12,030
Right, so the request that I've been specifically given is

39
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:16,280
to build a PC that will last five years and more.

40
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:21,660
So I figured to myself, we're going to make it last five years and more,

41
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,930
one way or another.

42
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:27,130
However, budget struck, and the moment I'm done picking parts,

43
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:28,800
we suddenly ran out of money for some parts.

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
And I thought to myself, I'm not going to sacrifice some other parts.

45
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,680
They're too good to be sacrificed for.

46
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:37,530
So I thought to myself, let's yeet and downgrade the motherboard a little.

47
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,860
Now, you may think to yourself, picking this motherboard

48
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:41,860
may seem to be a harmless choice

49
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:45,810
considering how we got a real hefty VRM heatsink right here.

50
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:48,130
But wait till you see the processor.

51
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:51,210
Then you'll see the living nightmare that I'll be living in,

52
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:53,500
and it will forever haunt me for the rest of my life

53
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,650
for this kind of part choice.

54
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,690
It is an AMD Ryzen 7700*.

55
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:02,480
Now considering the use case of MamaMelori,

56
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:05,650
she pretty much don't really game at all,

57
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,430
not to mention she does not touch any games at all.

58
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:11,130
She only does spreadsheets, online surfing,

59
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:15,730
pretty much all the basic stuff that old people does sometimes.

60
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,900
So the build I went for is a GPU-less setup,

61
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,380
except the 7700 specifically has an integrated GPU.

62
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:28,460
Now I'm less worried about the integrated GPU because I couldn't really care.

63
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:32,530
She's not gaming, so as long as it runs, it runs, right?

64
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:35,380
So we're gonna get straight into the processing power of it.

65
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:39,010
So if you've watched the build mentality video that I filmed some time ago,

66
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:44,710
you would know that I am kind of a mild opposition to the big.LITTLE architecture

67
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:47,400
that Intel has since the 12th gen.

68
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,180
Well, I'm not really full oppositionist,

69
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:55,680
I'm just a little bit of a doubtist because support for it on FreeBSD

70
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:59,580
and probably some parts of Linux, I don't really know,

71
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:03,510
are not fully taking advantage of the big.LITTLE architecture yet.

72
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,410
So it didn't really bring my confidence up at all.

73
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:10,480
So that's why I went for a Ryzen build for the time being.

74
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,360
However, I still think it's not really too bad of a choice.

75
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:16,210
Wait till you see the other nightmares I have for you.

76
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:21,440
This is a Kingston Fury Beast and this thing has only 16 gigs.

77
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,800
As stupid as it sounds, I like to build PCs that are, well,

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,810
if I build it now, I expect it to last 5 years plus.

79
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:31,810
So I want to future proof it.

80
00:04:31,816 --> 00:04:35,110
Although plenty of people would say future proofing is stupid

81
00:04:35,116 --> 00:04:38,460
and future proofing is dumb because 5 years later,

82
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:41,260
the prices of these things are going to go really really down.

83
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:43,110
I totally understand you.

84
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,100
However, for someone who has no cash flow

85
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,050
and only has a certain batch of money at that one time,

86
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,910
I believe this is a sensible build

87
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:56,880
that could hold me off for quite some time admittedly.

88
00:04:56,883 --> 00:04:58,460
So I have a second one.

89
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:01,930
So that means 2 of these total up to 32 gigs.

90
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:02,830
Simple.

91
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,690
For this next part, I can guarantee you

92
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,710
that you're bound to flame me in the comments.

93
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:10,880
For a board like this, I got myself a Samsung 980.

94
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:13,080
Now on my personal justification,

95
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,850
I'm trying really hard to go ham on processing power first

96
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,280
and everything else second.

97
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:20,930
So you can tell that this rig is without a doubt

98
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,980
a complete mental mess

99
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:26,250
and if anything, the inner machinations of my mind.

100
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,000
If this build is messy to you,

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,810
then you know the sort of person that I am.

102
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:33,610
I am more or less a very messy person.

103
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,030
Alright, let's get into building,

104
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:37,310
quit the chatter and let's just get straight into it.

105
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:39,460
Always check the manual before this.

106
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:40,890
However, I have not.

107
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,810
So I'm just gonna look at the legend up here.

108
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:46,760
And on the first glance, it just says first up here on the slots.

109
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:48,430
The second and the fourth.

110
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:54,730
So we should theoretically put those first so we get ourselves dual channel.

111
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,500
Where are the notches?

112
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,730
Oh, there you are.

113
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,680
Do you have notches here?

114
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:01,060
Nope, you're fixed.

115
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,380
Alright, in you go.

116
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:06,230
Following next it, we're gonna need to get the SSD in.

117
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,160
Gigabyte, are you really serious with me?

118
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,600
(tap tap)

119
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,750
That's loose.

120
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,980
I literally just got this board out of the packaging.

121
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:18,080
Okay, screwdriver.

122
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,460
Smol.

123
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:24,530
Ahh, Just let ya olde grandma have a sit while she works on this PC.

124
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:27,080
I wonder if this is a Gen 4 slot.

125
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:27,890
But you know what?

126
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:29,480
It doesn't really fucking matter.

127
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:31,910
This Samsung 980 is 3rd Gen.

128
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,890
So it really, really doesn't matter.

129
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,280
Just in we go.

130
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:37,330
Just make sure it's fully in.

131
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,300
You don't see the contacts anymore, simple as that.

132
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,110
Just leave her in there because we're gonna need to press her down

133
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:44,880
and try to put this thing back on.

134
00:06:44,883 --> 00:06:47,230
Oh my god!

135
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:51,350
Self reminder, always remember to remove the plastic

136
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,800
from the heat pads.

137
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,480
You'll thank me later.

138
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:56,410
Alright, we're on.

139
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,160
And lastly, we're gonna put one last thing.

140
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,480
I got gloves on.

141
00:07:02,616 --> 00:07:04,960
Ah, would you look at that.

142
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,830
Let's just keep this cover on for a bit.

143
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,800
Now one thing that did jump out to me is that

144
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,000
when you look at the processor, you would notice that on this corner,

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,410
it's on the upper right corner.

146
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:18,330
Usually in the older systems, they were at the bottom left corner.

147
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,890
It should be a triangle right here,

148
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,630
so we're gonna go triangle for triangle

149
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,610
and just drop her right in.

150
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:25,930
Right, we got the processor nicely put on.

151
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:27,680
So we're just gonna put her in.

152
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:32,830
And it should click right out if I'm not mistaken.

153
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:34,860
There you go.

154
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:38,210
And my thumb is not enough to reach that stupid thing.

155
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:42,630
Also, don't angle your thumb the way I did earlier.

156
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:45,930
There we go.

157
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,980
Please don't throw this, please don't consume this,

158
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:51,480
please don't eat it, please don't do whatever ri-donk-culous shit with it.

159
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:54,280
You're gonna need that when you RMA this motherboard.

160
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:56,690
Alright, we're pretty much more or less done.

161
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,010
I mean, this is the most simplest build ever.

162
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:01,880
And you'll be wondering to yourself, where's the cooler?

163
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:04,610
I've intentionally chose not to put on the cooler just yet,

164
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:08,360
because what comes next is going to scare the living shit out of you.

165
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:12,980
But we're gonna put this thing away first, so I can show you why.

166
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:16,010
The horror is, inside this case,

167
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:19,180
this cheapo case that I have found randomly online,

168
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:21,010
these thumbscrews are really weird.

169
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:22,350
Check this out.

170
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,600
This thumbscrew is, well,

171
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,230
looks barely anything like a thumbscrew.

172
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:30,430
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

173
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:33,980
If you understand this, you know this is a living hell.

174
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:37,330
This case has the orientation with the motherboards at the bottom,

175
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,160
and the power supply at the top.

176
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:44,130
Well, it's not too bad and all, but this case also has very, well,

177
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:47,110
shallow cable channels back here.

178
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,580
You can't even fit anything here.

179
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:54,010
So, this is pretty much a shit show of a case, I gotta be honest.

180
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:55,960
But let's be honest, what can we do?

181
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:58,080
So what we're gonna do first instead,

182
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,780
is to put this motherboard in,

183
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:01,860
and then we'll put the power supply,

184
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:03,380
and then we'll put the cooler.

185
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:04,980
God, please fucking save me.

186
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:09,380
Right, so we start with a really janky old plastic bag.

187
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,860
I'm gonna take this out off-camera.

188
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:15,810
You know, I was honestly expecting this to be a very simple build.

189
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,430
Oops, rookie mistake.

190
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:19,040
I forgot the I.O.shield.

191
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:21,750
Alright, let's click right in.

192
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,560
That'll do.

193
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,130
How are we supposed to get it in?

194
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,080
Like this?

195
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,080
Alright, there we go.

196
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, my fingers are getting kinked!

197
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,700
Seems about right.

198
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,100
Now, what we need to do is get some stand-off screws,

199
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,580
with a little bit of force,

200
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:40,850
just so we can align the screw hole to the stand-off screws.

201
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,730
There we go.

202
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:43,780
And screw her in.

203
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,350
Okay, now that we got one of them,

204
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,610
let's get the other one for the lower end.

205
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:52,030
And as you may know, handling with a pair of gloves as a VTuber,

206
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:54,350
yeah, that in itself is a living nightmare.

207
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,810
Okay, we got these and this of the stand-off screws now in.

208
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,280
And what I wanna do is get the rest in.

209
00:10:02,283 --> 00:10:04,230
These, these, these, these.

210
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:07,350
Basically get as many in as possible,

211
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,030
so that we keep the motherboard, well, really secure in there.

212
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,630
A bit of struggling later...

213
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,610
You know what I just realized about this case?

214
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:17,640
I probably screwed in the motherboard a little too soon,

215
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:20,700
because after fully screwing it in,

216
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,480
did I notice that there were very tiny runs for the front panel at the far bottom.

217
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:32,580
There's like, there's like a stupidly small 1mm gap under that.

218
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,430
Grrr, I freaking hate this case.

219
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,560
Now to summarize what I'm gonna be doing with the jump cut,

220
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:40,890
is to route these LED front panels,

221
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:46,080
and the power buttons, and the HDD indicator, the audio jack,

222
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:50,330
whatever you see that's on the front of the case is going down here.

223
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,500
And the USB is coming from the side right here.

224
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,360
Gosh darn it, I just realized something.

225
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,260
Considering how small this case is,

226
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:03,860
there is only like, yet another 1mm gap on that side.

227
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:07,430
But stupidly enough, that's where the SATA ports are,

228
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,560
facing that way, that wall.

229
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:11,640
And on this very particular motherboard,

230
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:14,610
that's also where the USB 3 is sitting.

231
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:18,080
Grrr, I'm gonna hate myself so much.

232
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:22,100
Instead of looking for a right angle connector from AliExpress,

233
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,130
I'm just gonna re-adapt this USB 3.1 Gen 2

234
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:29,180
to something that I can use on a 3.0 Gen 1.

235
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:31,060
That way I won't have to deal with the angle

236
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,110
and clearance issue over there.

237
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:37,630
Because god damn it, this case is such a nightmare, I gotta be honest.

238
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:40,080
Anyways, remember when you talk about the CPU connector?

239
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,290
Yeah, it's right there.

240
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,230
Well, imagine getting your hand in there,

241
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:46,680
not to mention with a giant blocky power supply in the way right here.

242
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:48,680
So, what we're gonna do is,

243
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:50,710
like I said earlier talking about the jump cut,

244
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:52,930
I'm going to try to cable manage it,

245
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:56,180
and then we're gonna run the cable first,

246
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,480
before I slide the power supply in on video.

247
00:11:58,483 --> 00:11:59,980
Way more suffering later...

248
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:02,500
My Android (Note 10+)

249
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,330
You can tell how ri-donk-culously long cable management has happened,

250
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,860
to the point that I have been watching Hololive clips.

251
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:15,030
But yes, I have cable managed pretty much everything,

252
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,610
before I resume recording this video.

253
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:20,760
This is beyond my sanity levels.

254
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:24,330
I needed those Hololive clips to keep me sane.

255
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,040
Alright, following next, I got myself

256
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:30,430
a Cooler Master MWE Gold 650 V2.

257
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:35,130
Now, I've kind of checked out a certain power supply tier list,
(This list from cultists.network, to be precise)

258
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:39,750
and although it may be not so good on my part to treat it as gospel,

259
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,410
I did read up a little bit more about it before I made that decision.

260
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,280
So, if you think this is a poor decision,

261
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:47,730
please let me know in the comments below.

262
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,610
But again, this is pretty much a budget build,

263
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:53,980
so this is pretty much the best that I can look for,

264
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,230
on top of having a very limited market,

265
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,680
where I can barely find anything.

266
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:01,480
Oh, I shouldn't really be putting it,

267
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:03,530
I should be plugging them in first.

268
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,710
To my absolute relief, there's only two cables,

269
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:11,380
the CPU and the 24-pin ATX connector.

270
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:13,950
Let's just connect them accordingly,

271
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,250
and slide her in.

272
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,830
Oh my god, it says PCIe and CPU.

273
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,810
What?

274
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:23,330
Never seen it use the same type of connectors for this.

275
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,130
What the hell?

276
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:28,290
Right, with those connectors in, I'm gonna slide her right in.

277
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:30,260
And I'm gonna have the fan face down,

278
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:33,730
because there is no intake on the top.

279
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:36,330
So, we're intaking it from the same place,

280
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,180
where everything else is breathing in.

281
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:40,310
And we're gonna sit her right there for now,

282
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:42,080
and try to screw her in.

283
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,610
Once we screw her in, we're gonna cable manage it.

284
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:48,250
Because we're gonna need some space for the last part.

285
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,500
Okay, with that done, let's try to cable manage it.

286
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,380
But because of how flimsy I can be with gloves,

287
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:58,600
I'm gonna try to do another jump cut with this.

288
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,640
Alright, I tried my extreme best,

289
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:02,610
but with my brutal honesty,

290
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:04,210
this case is terrible.

291
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:06,890
Because there's really no space in the back.

292
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,310
Like, if I were to try to tilt this PC right now,

293
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,000
if you look based on the motherboard,

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,360
you will see that there's barely any space back here.

295
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:17,180
If I put it over to this side,

296
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:20,130
yeah, you can't fit anything in there.

297
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,680
This case is genuinely such a nightmare,

298
00:14:22,683 --> 00:14:25,680
which is also why it's currently on that side.

299
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:28,000
So, we're gonna try to push it to the other side,

300
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,360
and make some space for the final thing of this build.

301
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:33,790
And I swear to god,

302
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:38,790
this is the most time consuming bit of my life.

303
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,160
The stock cooler.

304
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,330
So, imagine the horrors in my face

305
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:49,560
when I was imagining myself putting a stock cooler with gloves on.

306
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:51,010
Seriously, I'm not fucking with that.

307
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,200
We're doing another jump cut.

308
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,780
Yeet!

309
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:53,360
There we go.

310
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:53,950
We got it.

311
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,260
Ugh, this is such a nightmare.

312
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:57,140
I swear to god.

313
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:59,660
Now, if you're wondering why there are no fans at the end,

314
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,060
why is there no exhaust,

315
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,960
well, to put it simply,

316
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:05,560
I didn't think this is 80mm.

317
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:06,730
I've not prepared for this.

318
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:08,930
I have none in stock.
(I rechecked it was 120mm, my bad, I'm an idiot)

319
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:10,850
But regardless, I'm glad that there's at least

320
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,860
some form of intake from the power supply.

321
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:17,780
So, at least we're going to have some two intakes over here.

322
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,200
So, we're gonna have some heat going in,

323
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,260
and then probably go up through the power supply,

324
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:25,100
then exit through here.

325
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,360
But, usually I wouldn't recommend doing that,

326
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:30,080
because that would be pretty dumb.

327
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,710
Especially in the case that,

328
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:35,230
where this is the most vulnerable to heat sometimes.

329
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:38,110
So, ehhh.

330
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:40,250
Gotta make do what I gotta make do.

331
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,210
Because this case is not really my choice.

332
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:44,950
Only everything internal is,

333
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,710
but not this case.

334
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:48,280
This case is not my choice.

335
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:50,960
So, I had to work with it, and

336
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:52,640
it was kind of a bit of a nightmare,

337
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:56,360
but we're finally here, so

338
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:58,290
about time we close it up!

339
00:15:58,299 --> 00:15:59,680
Ehhh.

340
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:02,780
You know, this video was supposed to have

341
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:05,250
included an installation video,

342
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,880
but because of what time I was filming in,

343
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:11,880
which is 7:30am JST,
(The sun already rose LMAO)

344
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:15,910
pretty much I am way too freaking late in this.

345
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,130
So, instead I'm just gonna post some pictures

346
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:19,880
of me working on the setup.
(Since I chose Linux Mint, I just designed it
"Mint Fantome themed. She's so cute)

347
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:23,030
Basically just testing things out to see if they work,

348
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,450
and if it works you get to see those pictures.

349
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,280
But, regardless, I'm done assembling a fresh new PC.

350
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:30,880
I'm gonna test it out tomorrow.

351
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:33,180
Thank you all so so so so much for watching.

directly discuss about tech, anything,

362
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,910
and yeah, with that said,

363
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,850
I'll probably make a separate video about Linux,

364
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,110
because I really really wanted to make this video a Linux video,

365
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:08,080
but because of how late it is now,

366
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,860
I don't think it's possible.

367
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:13,280
Not to mention the prep time just to get my outfit done.

368
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,930
Oh, it's such a nightmare.

369
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:19,960
The filming of this whole video is a nightmare altogether,

370
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:22,610
because cable managing in this case,

371
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:24,010
this dumbass case,

372
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:26,330
took me way too long to count,

373
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,380
and I don't enjoy it.

374
00:17:28,383 --> 00:17:30,380
Anyways, thanks for watching,

375
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,760

376

377
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:39,430
