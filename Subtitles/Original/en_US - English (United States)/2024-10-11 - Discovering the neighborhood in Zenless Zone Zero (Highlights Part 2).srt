1
00:00:00,283 --> 00:00:02,360
Are we live yet?

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,410
It's been a while since I last hear that BGM.

3
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:12,230
Hello, welcome fellow live viewers, VOD watchers.

4
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:14,260
What you're about to see is going to be

5
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:17,930
a major first step to a major change to this channel.

6
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:20,550
This major change is going to happen progressively.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,610
It's not going to be a one click or a one snap,

8
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:27,910
but I'm hoping to be able to do all these changes over time

9
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,880
and eventually into something really really big.

10
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:35,260
So I hope you join me on the ride and I look forward to this.

11
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:39,460
With that said, I hope you enjoy the first start and the first change

12
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:42,080
to the live stream part of MeloriTensei.

13
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,660
See ya in a few minutes.

14
00:00:53,633 --> 00:01:02,080
Melori's Zenless Zone Zero Adventures - Part 2
The Soda, The Neighborhood, The Breaches.

15
00:01:07,616 --> 00:01:08,900
Yaaaaaa,

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,410
Kon-Melo Kon-Melo Kon-Melo,

17
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:13,560
it's ya Tech Wizardess girl, MeloriTensei!

18
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:15,340
Hello hello hello!

19
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:16,830
It's been a while, hasn't it?

20
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:20,810
Like, you've been seeing videos out of me, but you have not seen streams for so long.

21
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:23,830
Well, we're finally back with a stream, yippee!

22
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,410
We're finally back streaming again!

23
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:26,660
We're finally back again!

24
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,430
Yippee yippee yippee!

25
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:32,360
So, as you may have noticed, most of my assets have changed.

26
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:36,080
Like, my starting soon screen now has looked a whole lot different.

27
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,060
What do you guys think?

28
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:39,840
VOD watchers, live viewers, what do you guys think?

29
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,660
Let me know in the comments below.

30
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:45,660
So another major thing is, as you may have noticed, the BGM has changed.

31
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,630
I figured to myself I kind of want something a whole lot more…

32
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:51,630
I want to have more vibes to this, more than just lo-fi.

33
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:54,710
So I thought, let's go hunt up for more BGMs.

34
00:01:54,716 --> 00:02:00,010
And also, if you haven't noticed, in the past year of streaming,

35
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:03,210
the BGM has really driven me crazy.

36
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:09,310
So to combat that, what I have done is I have added way more BGMs than ever.

37
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:14,050
Unfortunately, you won't be hearing the BGMs that you've been hearing in the past.

38
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,910
That has been completely replaced, unfortunately.

39
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:21,440
However, I can assure you that these are a playlist of bangers.

40
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:25,190
So I hope you continue to enjoy and feel really comfy about this.

41
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,980
However, for this stream, I don't think you'll be hearing

42
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:31,330
the playlist that I have picked for the stream just yet.

43
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:35,750
So I've been thinking for a while now, I haven't really put that much thought to

44
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,110
how I would really want a certain screen to look like.

45
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:41,800
So like, say if there's a technical issue and stuff,

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,980
I usually have a BRB screen when that happens.

47
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:46,480
So I have changed that as well.

48
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:50,960
And we got a different playlist of BGMs for it now, finally.

49
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:57,510
So in the past, the chatting and BRB screen were one screen, uh, were one playlist.

50
00:02:57,516 --> 00:02:59,780
Not anymore.

51
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,560
Yep.

52
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:06,510
It's kind of adorable.

53
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:07,910
I find it adorable.

54
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:11,690
The idea I was going with was to give it a goofy vibe.

55
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:14,180
So like, "oopies!".

56
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:16,960
Kind of, you know, that kind of funny vibe.

57
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:20,510
You'll get to see that when I run into technical issues.

58
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:25,680
And as you may have noticed, I got a new transition as well.

59
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:30,480
Although there are quite a number of assets that I have removed that were particularly

60
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:33,030
of OwOsRikos, I have also added a few.

61
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:37,330
So technically, she's not out of my asset list.

62
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,030
So big shoutouts to OwOsRikos.

63
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,330
OwOsRikos! Riko!

64
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,400
Are you watching?

65
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,440
Because this, I highly appreciate your assets.

66
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:49,580
I've been using your assets for some videos, like this background.

67
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,030
It was in my ASMR video.

68
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,830
I hope that's perfectly fine.

69
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,730
Although I'm still gonna call myself the Tech Wizardess,

70
00:03:56,733 --> 00:04:00,260
I may, I may change some, some, um,

71
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:03,380
some small things like maybe the theme

72
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:07,300
or the vibe by a little bit, like 1%, just, just, just a,

73
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,980
just a centimeter off, kind of thing.

74
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,130
But we'll see.

75
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,410
It takes a whole lot of experiment.

76
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,980
It takes a whole lot of experimenting, a whole lot of understanding

77
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:19,410
and to see, to see what I really want to be.

78
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,890
But regardless, I'm glad that you guys joined me on the ride.

79
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:25,810
I'm hoping that more people could financially support me so I can,

80
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:30,560
so I can be financially stable and be able to continue making content the way it is,

81
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:31,800
because I'm going to keep putting up,

82
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,880
I'm going to keep upgrading the content and it does take quite a lot.

83
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:39,130
I would say financially and mentally,

84
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:43,230
but I'm hoping to bring up everything as we go.

85
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:44,440
We'll scale as we go.

86
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:49,230
So with that said, special thanks to a, to a Ko-Fi member that we currently have.

87
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:53,960
Thanks, Jo, for, for being my member for, I think, three months?

88
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:58,110
And also all the one-off donations that Jo has been donating to keep,

89
00:04:58,116 --> 00:04:59,380
keep some stuff alive.

90
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,480
I greatly appreciate those.

91
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:04,690
Right, without further ado, let's get back into the main content.

92
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,610
Oh wait, before that, just next to my table.

93
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:07,310
Okay, right.

94
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:08,860
We got something hilarious.

95
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:12,940
So I was supposed to do this on the first Zenless Zone Zero stream.

96
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,280
Unfortunately, I completely forgot about it and I left it in the fridge.

97
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,810
So basically, I was being stupid.

98
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:23,630
So what I want to do is I want to try out soda water.

99
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:27,210
I don't know what you call that everywhere else, but some people call it tonic water,

100
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:29,360
some people call it soda water.

101
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:32,260
It's basically just carbonated water.

102
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:36,160
I've never tried it before because I don't think I've ever heard of it before.

103
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,300
Oh my god, it's so difficult.

104
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,030
I feel like it has been compressed for a long time or something.

105
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:43,110
Ooh, there we go.

106
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:46,560
Right. (sniffs)

107
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:47,960
I don't smell anything.

108
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:48,960
I smell nothing.

109
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:50,330
Right, let's give it a try.

110
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,880
Ugh, wow, that's weird.

111
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:56,130
Wow!

112
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:57,860
That is weird.

113
00:05:57,866 --> 00:06:00,710
It's like you got, you got, you got, what do you call that?

114
00:06:00,716 --> 00:06:03,360
Like, it's like you got distilled water.

115
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:04,860
Like it's not mineral water.

116
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:07,510
It's, it tasted like distilled water.

117
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:08,390
And then you put, you,

118
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,660
you pump a whole lot of CO2 carbonation into it or something.

119
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,600
Holy, what the f-

120
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,180
This is so weird.

121
00:06:17,883 --> 00:06:22,360
Okay, on the second taste, it's almost like, it's starting to get less bad now.

122
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:28,730
It's like it tastes, it tastes better than sparkling water or something.

123
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,130
I don't know because I, I've only tried one and it was,

124
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:37,760
it came from France and it tasted really weird.

125
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,780
Like it's not the fermentation, I don't know,

126
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:42,060
it's just something felt, felt really off.

127
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:43,410
And it's not expired.

128
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,730
It's, I don't know, it's, it's just so weird.

129
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:52,210
Right, what I want to try next is, what if I put tea into it?

130
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:56,600
So I'm gonna pour it by the rim, like so.

131
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,640
Oh my god, it's, it's already fizzing up like as, as it reaches the bottom.

132
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:02,380
What's going on?

133
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:04,940
Is this how soda water supposed to work?

134
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:11,430
Probably half, like half a mug of soda water and another half a mug of tea.

135
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,060
I bet it's gonna taste weird.

136
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,730
I bet it tastes weird.

137
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:17,430
Right, let me just give it a try now.

138
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:28,330
Whoa, what the, what in the world?

139
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,360
Okay, that, that in itself is weird.

140
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:32,600
That is so weird.

141
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,380
I don't know what I, I don't know what I was expecting.

142
00:07:35,383 --> 00:07:37,460
I genuinely do not.

143
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:43,430
It's like I have diluted the, I've diluted the tea so much I could not even taste the tea at all.

144
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,460
It's just all soda.

145
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,530
Okay, no.

146
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:52,010
No.

147
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:55,180
I'll have them separately, thank you.

148
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:59,460
It's better when you're making cocktails after all.

149
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:01,310
Oh god.

150
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:02,430
Ugh.

151
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:06,360
I got so much carbonation in, in me right now.

152
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:07,830
Excuse me.

153
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:13,710
To self, don't ever buy soda water unless you're actually making a cocktail.

154
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:19,360
Or I don't know, mango soda at least.

155
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,730
Right.

156
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:25,210
Without further ado, let's get into, let's get into the game.

157
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:29,350
All right, let's get into the, let's get into the, let's get into the...

158
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,500
whatever we left off.

159
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,680
Because if we press escape right now, as you can see

160
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:38,880
I still have not set a name yet because the game still hasn't let me.

161
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:41,160
So we're gonna get into that.

162
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,610
Hello Wise, it's been three months.

163
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,130
We deleted the last alternate account after we finished.

164
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:52,260
This time, you can use my info to create a new account again.

165
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,260
Oh.

166
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:57,480
I was just talking about my account.

167
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:01,790
Open the Inter-Knot and register an alt account.

168
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,280
Ey, there we go.

169
00:09:03,283 --> 00:09:04,730
Right, let's...

170
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:07,280
Right, what should we call ourselves?

171
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:08,880
Right.

172
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:11,260
I'm calling myself CyberMelo.

173
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,130
Right, let's register as CyberMelo.

174
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,480
We can change after all, right?

175
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:17,810
Something happened to my delivery.

176
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:19,660
An intriguing new commission?

177
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,730
Let me have a look.

178
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:23,810
Yes, judging by this ID and the content, it seems like someone we know.

179
00:09:23,816 --> 00:09:29,130
If I'm not mistaken, the requester should be General Chop from Waterfall Soup.

180
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:31,680
You forgot to switch the account back to Phaethon.

181
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:36,560
From General Chop's perspective, the one taking on the request is the new Proxy named CyberMelo.

182
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:38,760
He might find it a bit suspicious.

183
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:43,280
In that case, why don't you see General Chop and explain the situation?

184
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:47,230
By the way, Susie from the Box Galaxy gadget store just contacted us.

185
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:50,600
She said she had something to ask us.

186
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,110
Metro Goblin.

187
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:54,200
We-~

188
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,810
Sorry, I'm not gonna repeat that ever again.

189
00:09:57,816 --> 00:09:59,680
Check out the Sixth street.

190
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,410
Right, let's have a look at the Sixth street.

191
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:05,080
Okay, now that I'm out the door, let's start the daily ritual.

192
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,390
Scratch cards at the newsstand.

193
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:16,360
All right, so we're gacha-ing even in near reality, I guess.

194
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,580
Aw, that's so adorable!

195
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,730
Right c- oh.

196
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:24,410
Oh my god!

197
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,700
Oh my god, HoYoVerse, that's so cool!

198
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,780
You can- you can scratch with your right s-

199
00:10:28,783 --> 00:10:29,680
That is so cool!

200
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:31,010
Okay, I like that.

201
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:32,540
What the heck?

202
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,430
Right, let's speak to General Chop.

203
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,430
Hello, General Chop.

204
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:37,210
Argh!

205
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:39,180
How annoying!

206
00:10:39,183 --> 00:10:40,540
What's the matter?

207
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:42,830
Ahh...! It's you.

208
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,260
Sorry, but I can't take your order right now.

209
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:48,710
And all because of Pegasos Logistics!

210
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:51,230
The ingredients I ordered haven't arrived yet.

211
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,580
I just ran a track and trace on the order.

212
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:59,030
Apparently, they somehow sent everything into a Hollow.

213
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:03,560
I've already posted a request on the Inter-Knot to find the truck.

214
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:07,010
Proxy named CyberMelo accepted the job earlier.

215
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:12,850
The account is new though, so I'm not sure if it's reliable or not.

216
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,430
Hold on, let me just lean away.

217
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,130
"Points to yourself."

218
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:25,610
(Seagull Mel laughing)

219
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:26,160
Huh!

220
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,540
You're the one who accepted the job?

221
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:29,540
CyberMelo is you, huh?

222
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:30,730
Oh, I see.

223
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,580
You created a new account to make certain things easier.

224
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,010
I got so flustered earlier.

225
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:37,390
I should have just come directly to your store for help.

226
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,810
I shouldn't have wasted time on the Inter-Knot.

227
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:43,410
But since you've taken on the job, I'm somewhat relieved.

228
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,180
Right.

229
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:46,430
Susie.

230
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:47,710
From the gadget store.

231
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:49,600
Wait, this is the gadget store?

232
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,030
Box Galaxy.

233
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,350
It looks like an arcade.

234
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,360
What- what?

235
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,980
Aw.

236
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,060
Hello, welcome!

237
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:02,110
What is it?

238
00:12:18,216 --> 00:12:20,980
So, what do I have to do?

239
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,560
Okay.

240
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:34,680
So I assume…

241
00:12:34,683 --> 00:12:37,480
This person's lost in the Hollow?

242
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:42,060
Oh no, it's about-

243
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:43,310
Okay.

244
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:46,140
W-Engines, okay.

245
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:02,430
Okay.

246
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:04,810
All right, cool.

247
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:20,140
Whoa!

248
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:22,450
Where did you come from, Anby?

249
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,330
Anby, what are you doing here?

250
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:37,980
Aw, she's innocent!

251
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:42,510
Uh.

252
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:44,140
Um.

253
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:46,850
Uh.

254
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,980
It's a slang.

255
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:02,500
Oh!

256
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,380
Oh, poor Susie!

257
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,960
Alright.

258
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,860
Okay.

259
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:31,350
Okay.

260
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,660
Since Susie has no idea about her boss's side gig,

261
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:39,230
let's be careful not to spill the beans while discussing the commission with her.

262
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:42,350
Okay, second commission!

263
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,030
You've accepted the commission, are you going to enter the Hollow now?

264
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:48,580
As Proxies, we can roam freely within the Hollow.

265
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,680
Which isn't easy for most people, at least.

266
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:54,660
But still, we need agents with combat experience, like the Cunning Hares,

267
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,230
to handle Ethereals and other dangers.

268
00:14:57,233 --> 00:15:01,360
As usual, you should get in touch with the trusted agents to accompany you.

269
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,680
Signal Search has been unlocked.

270
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,380
What is Signal Search?

271
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:08,230
Oh!

272
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,810
Is this gacha?

273
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:11,830
So, we got 21 right now.

274
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,290
Okay, we got 21 at the moment.

275
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:16,530
That's interesting.

276
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,700
Oh, the BGM though.

277
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:23,110
So we got one A.

278
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:25,910
Awesome, who are we getting for A?

279
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:30,730
Ayy, we got an A, finally!

280
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:34,780
So it's an A W engine then.

281
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:38,360
Right, here we go.

282
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,500
Woo!

283
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,830
Wow, there's vocals to this song?

284
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,780
So that means when there's vocals, there's S?

285
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:56,890
Or something?

286
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:02,630
Hell yeah, this is such a vibe!

287
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,180
Let's go!

288
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:06,430
Where is it?

289
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:13,040
No way!

290
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:17,890
Okay, we got Nekomiya immediately.

291
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:22,600
One break later...

292
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,140
Ayy, I'm back.

293
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:29,160
Let's just say I got something real fizzy.

294
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,460
Ah, much better.

295
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:35,110
But I still got a single mouthful of soda water left to drink.

296
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:38,110
Let me try to finish the soda water.

297
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:42,210
Oh god, the soda water is tasteless as hell.

298
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:44,260
Venture into the uncharted depths of the Hollow.

299
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:49,710
It's essential to navigate your paths on the monitor array through the HDD.

300
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:54,380
With your path laid out, all you need to do is fight and eliminate the threats in the Hollow.

301
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:57,610
Outstanding Commissions, 2.

302
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,160
Ultimate collectibles.

303
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,410
Locate the missing W-Engine crate.

304
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,040
Okay, here we go.

305
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:09,080
Oh, we're back to the television.

306
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,560
Nya~ She's so adorable.

307
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:17,830
There we go!

308
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,630
Oh, that…

309
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:20,250
Woo!

310
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,810
That was satisfying, I gotta be honest.

311
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:24,450
That was satisfying.

312
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:28,750
Oh damn, the camera work.

313
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,930
Especially with Nekomata.

314
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:32,450
Oiii~

315
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:36,730
Let's go!

316
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,250
Oh, so that's her ult.

317
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,290
That's cool!

318
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,530
That's cool, I gotta be honest.

319
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:46,910
That's serious stuff.

320
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:50,260
And I've just defeated everyone with her alone.

321
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:53,200
I don't think I've swapped in this one.

322
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:58,130
And that's straight to the exit.

323
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:03,250
Okay, we've collected all observation datas.

324
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,000
And polychromes, denies.

325
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,380
Hmm, okay, let's get in there.

326
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,200
Whoa, her damage is good.

327
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,900
Seriously, do I have a fill form for this?

328
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,610
Of course!

329
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:27,760
It's your damn job!

330
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,960
You're an investigator!

331
00:18:31,966 --> 00:18:35,830
Well, that's all for the mission, I suppose.

332
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:38,010
Okay, we got S rank for this.

333
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,010
Nice.

334
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:46,960
Pretty cool.

335
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:50,910
By the way, Pegasos called shortly after we went into the Hollow for the commission.

336
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:55,180
They told me the driver has been brought out of the Hollow by someone from the association.

337
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:59,000
Wait, that means I sent you there for nothing?

338
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,780
Well, it's better to, uh, on the side of caution.

339
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:06,030
Belle, you're so reliable.

340
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:09,610
Anyway, I thought I'd treat you to a meal once you come back.

341
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:10,750
What would you like to eat?

342
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,780
Today, I'm pulling out all stops to give you my specials.

343
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:14,700
All right, here we go!

344
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,980
What you got?

345
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:17,330
Gotcha.

346
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:23,030
Unlocks at level 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30.

347
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:23,590
Dang it!

348
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,950
Okay.

349
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,630
What, what is this?

350
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,900
Vegetable noodles.

351
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,780
For 30+ attack.

352
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:32,290
Okay, that's cool.

353
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:38,980
But damn, he says he's gonna give us anything and we're, and we chose vegetable noodles.

354
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:41,630
Are you serious?

355
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:42,510
Game!

356
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,510
Why?

357
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,200
You could have,

358
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,080
you could have at least given us a basic chashu ramen for, for, for, um,

359
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,000
for meat lovers.

360
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,730
Come on!

361
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,250
Dang it!

362
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,960
You sorted everything out?

363
00:19:57,966 --> 00:20:00,230
Yeah, let your boss know.

364
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,310
By the way, let me ask you secretly, Belle.

365
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:06,030
That W-Engine boss gave you, did you give it to that cute girl for fighting?

366
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,330
(PANIK...)

367
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,730
Stay calm and think of how to respond.

368
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:17,090
Oh no, no, yeah, I mean for battling other players, right?

369
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:19,290
So, did you win?

370
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:21,310
(DOES SHE KNOW?)

371
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:23,030
So, okay, okay, hold on.

372
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:25,310
Let me just have a look.

373
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:31,580
Oh, so this is how you get it, okay.

374
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:35,360
Oh, you can recycle W-Engines as well, that's cool.

375
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,160
Oh?

376
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:41,430
Brooooo!

377
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:44,110
That was fast.

378
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:45,760
Looks like you've already met the neighbors.

379
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,510
You always take so long to read my texts.

380
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:49,410
I was gonna head out and look for you.

381
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,210
Is something urgent happened?

382
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:55,610
Nope, just got a DM from Nicole and they'll be coming over real soon.

383
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:58,080
Hello there!

384
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,290
Special event.

385
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,560
All right, so we're about to get it done, huh?

386
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,450
Okay.

387
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,160
Oh.

388
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:35,830
Don't, don't make, don't make me, don't make me one star you on Yelp.

389
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:41,400
I'll show you customer rights!

390
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:44,400
Oh my god.

391
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,960
So, that's what the breaking up, the sound breaking out was for, right?

392
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:01,160
So, the audio breaking up wasn't me.

393
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,110
It's not my PC.

394
00:22:02,116 --> 00:22:06,400
Oh, what a goddamn relief.

395
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,950
Data connection unstable.

396
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,630
Attempting to re-connect.

397
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,380
Oh my god, I just noticed.

398
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:15,500
Did you notice that?

399
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,660
H.D. œD

400
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:22,980
Holy.

401
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:27,230
WHHHHITEEEE NNoi$

402
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:30,780
Oh?

403
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:35,280
Oh, we're losing, we're losing signal.

404
00:22:36,516 --> 00:22:40,660
Oh?

405
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,710
What happened?

406
00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:54,700
Huh.

407
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:59,000
Access denied.

408
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,530
Huh.

409
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,830
We have been hacked.

410
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:17,060
Database formatting in-

411
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:20,400
Oh, not one of those. They...

412
00:23:24,566 --> 00:23:26,950
Oh.

413
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:31,860
Ransomware.

414
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:36,710
Screen flickers into action as a video sent by a mysterious hacker begins to play.

415
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:39,840
Three familiar figures come into the view.

416
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,230
Oh, don't tell me they're flooding in more (enemies)

417
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,780
Oh no.

418
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,880
No.

419
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,760
That face.

420
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:21,980
Oh, there's the red eyes.

421
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:31,430
So you guys have not been paying off, have you?

422
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:34,410
Okay, god damn it.

423
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:36,580
I get it.

424
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:44,630
Is she gonna give a random code?

425
00:24:50,283 --> 00:24:53,380
But unfortunately.

426
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:59,630
Oh, that was cool.

427
00:25:03,683 --> 00:25:05,780
What a threat.

428
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:09,360
Haha, dumbass.

429
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:28,310
How about we just report them?

430
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:42,260
Ha ha ha. Ha~

431
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:44,450
Such a wuss.

432
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:50,710
(Mel's Ambulance noises)

433
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:57,780
We have reported you to the police.

434
00:25:57,783 --> 00:26:00,530
To the house of the hackers.

435
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:16,910
So basically, now that they have taken over our systems, the IP address is now going to them.

436
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:24,750
So that means if they self-report, in theory, it now goes to them instead of us.

437
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,180
That's some 5D chess!

438
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,380
And... they left.

439
00:26:52,383 --> 00:26:54,260
We're back!

440
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,360
All right.

441
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:08,400
Nice.

442
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:12,160
Cool.

443
00:27:12,783 --> 00:27:15,060
We have retrieved.

444
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:32,860
Aww.

445
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:42,540
Aww.

446
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:49,210
So you're secretly a good person?

447
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,250
That squeal.

448
00:28:06,283 --> 00:28:08,910
Little late to be screaming.

449
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:16,310
Yup, we're back!

450
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:19,460
So what we gotta do is we have to open,

451
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:21,280
unlock these doors, I assume.

452
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,860
So we got a button over there.

453
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:25,650
And we got some enemies over here with a giant loot.

454
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,030
So we're gonna go grab the big fat loot for them.

455
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:32,380
I'm terribly sorry because I am greedy for money.

456
00:28:32,383 --> 00:28:33,860
Haha.

457
00:28:33,866 --> 00:28:35,760
Let's go.

458
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:41,900
Nice!

459
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,760
That was smooth.

460
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:43,730
That was really smooth.

461
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:45,310
I like that.

462
00:28:45,316 --> 00:28:46,060
Right.

463
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:47,930
We got some big fat loot.

464
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:49,700
Here we go.

465
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,150
Right.

466
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,010
Now we're gonna head over there and get to the button.

467
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,060
Open her up.

468
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:58,900
Aww. Ain't you just…

469
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,960
What?

470
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:00,510
You're just…

471
00:29:00,516 --> 00:29:01,150
You're just a…

472
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,540
You're just a bypass.

473
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:03,660
God damn it.

474
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,760
Welp, we got a boss to take care of.

475
00:29:05,766 --> 00:29:07,910
Here we go.

476
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:09,160
Aww, no…

477
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,080
No swap...

478
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,460
No swap suggestions?

479
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,280
Screw it.

480
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:14,880
It's showtime!

481
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:16,630
Oh my god, this dude's…

482
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:18,780
I'm using a Chinese track.

483
00:29:18,783 --> 00:29:20,160
And he's saying "It's show time!"

484
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,080
in the Chinese track.

485
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:23,040
That's so cool.

486
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:24,960
Alright.

487
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,310
Nope, we got kicked off.

488
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:40,160
I may be a Proxy but I'm not that merciless.

489
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:49,500
What about the Ethereal?

490
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:52,000
Where's the Ethereal though?

491
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,160
Ah, there it is.

492
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:57,310
Woo, what a timing.

493
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:00,210
Swap.

494
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:02,160
Swap.

495
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:05,260
That was quite a nice swap lineup.

496
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:07,810
Ayy, we killed them anyways.

497
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:09,830
I guess.

498
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,680
The strongbox.

499
00:30:14,383 --> 00:30:16,760
I knew it!

500
00:30:24,816 --> 00:30:26,810
Okay.

501
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:31,160
All for the money, I suppose.

502
00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:36,980
Huh.

503
00:30:36,983 --> 00:30:38,860
It's a plugin.

504
00:30:38,866 --> 00:30:41,710
Or attachment of some sort, huh?

505
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,810
Oh, it's a memory card!

506
00:30:44,816 --> 00:30:45,310
Okay, wait.

507
00:30:45,316 --> 00:30:46,460
No, no, no.

508
00:30:46,466 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm bad.

509
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,840
I'm bad at understanding this.

510
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:55,110
Ayy, get downloaded.

511
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:57,930
What?

512
00:30:57,933 --> 00:31:00,060
So what do we get?

513
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,580
How we're getting that memory card?

514
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,530
Chances are we might be able to get…

515
00:31:05,383 --> 00:31:06,160
Whoa.

516
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:09,700
Chances are we might be able to get more commissions relating to the…

517
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what is that?

518
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:22,860
No, this is sensory overload.

519
00:31:22,866 --> 00:31:23,410
Holy shit.

520
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:24,780
What, what, what, what the…

521
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,400
What in the world am I just seeing?

522
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,200
What the heck?

523
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,030
Holy…

524
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:31,980
What, what the heck?

525
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:36,730
I wonder what that means.

526
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:41,130
What happened?

527
00:31:42,516 --> 00:31:44,630
Was it like a future?

528
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:46,810
An alternative dimension?

529
00:31:46,816 --> 00:31:49,060
What is going on?

530
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:54,910
What actually happens if we agree or disagree?

531
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,810
If we disagree…

532
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:00,360
Well, here goes nothing.

533
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:25,630
Oh we have no choice.

534
00:32:26,266 --> 00:32:30,130
So the software is really overloading someone.

535
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:36,810
All right.

536
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,360
Okay.

537
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:50,860
Huh.

538
00:32:56,566 --> 00:32:58,430
Huh.

539
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,460
You didn't secretly record me, did you?

540
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:12,980
That would be creepy, right?

541
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:15,080
I mean…

542
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,510
What?

543
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:27,060
So we got a new software installed?

544
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:29,230
I suppose.

545
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:38,010
Huh.

546
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:41,590
Hello, morning!

547
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,040
Whoa, whoa.

548
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,930
Huh.

549
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:36,880
Okay.

550
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:39,050
So…

551
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,330
Huh.

552
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,910
What is in the video archive?

553
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:44,060
Let's have a look.

554
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,810
Stores video recordings of the important plot.

555
00:34:47,816 --> 00:34:49,210
Oh, so we can look back to it.

556
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,460
Okay, that's cool.

557
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:55,230
Let's get some rest and let's look at what's coming up next in our commission.

558
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:57,810
I mean, not commission, like missions.

559
00:34:57,816 --> 00:35:04,960
See what comes up next and I'll see if we could keep going on for a little bit longer.

560
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:10,180
Rest till morning.

561
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:15,210
Of course, we gotta have a little bit of late night surfing, cuz…

562
00:35:15,216 --> 00:35:17,380
Don't we all?

563
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:18,810
I had trouble sleeping.

564
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,410
Makes sense, considering everything that went down yesterday.

565
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:23,930
Taking a breather for a few days might be a good call.

566
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:25,650
But we had a good way to relax.

567
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,910
How about we focus on managing the video store for a change of pace?

568
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:36,650
You can take charge of retrieving the overdue videotapes rented by our neighbors before the store opens.

569
00:35:39,783 --> 00:35:45,730
She says "Hey, would you like to play a game and relax a little?"

570
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:46,480
I feel like I've forgotten something.

571
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:48,460
Maybe I left the stove on and forgot the clock.

572
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:49,900
Morning!

573
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,400
Oh, it's you.

574
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,380
Seeing you makes me feel like I forgot something relating to you.

575
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:56,080
The video store is reopening.

576
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,760
Has your vacation ended?

577
00:35:57,766 --> 00:35:58,410
Oh, I remember now.

578
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:00,030
The videotape I borrowed is due today.

579
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,610
Sorry for making you come all this way.

580
00:36:01,616 --> 00:36:10,250
Keeping track of every little thing in life is so much tougher than playing games that only rely on short term memory.

581
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,280
Oh my god, I could not be so called out right now.

582
00:36:13,283 --> 00:36:16,110
What is going on?

583
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,030
Welcome, welcome.

584
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,900
I'm sorry, the cafe isn't open today.

585
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,560
Why not?

586
00:36:24,566 --> 00:36:29,430
The Coff Cafe is currently getting new equipment and selecting new seasonal bean varieties.

587
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:32,830
I'm looking forward to the newest batch of dark roasted beans.

588
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:40,010
But the delivery of goods on both sites has been delayed due to a Hollow, which means the coffee shop won't be able to do business for a while.

589
00:36:40,016 --> 00:36:41,060
Oh hang on, I just remembered.

590
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,090
One of the videotapes I rented out is almost overdue.

591
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:46,260
I should take this chance in returning it to you.

592
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,730
They sure are adorable bunches, aren't they?

593
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:53,630
Welcome!

594
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:54,300
What's that?

595
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,940
Need a videotape?

596
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:57,010
The one our boss borrowed?

597
00:36:57,016 --> 00:36:59,010
Right here, here it goes.

598
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:03,150
Just about overdue, please take it quickly.

599
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:06,680
Belle, I ran into a cat at the street corner...

600
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,060
There's a little black cat, seems like a sort of thing you like.

601
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:12,730
I'll be there in no time.

602
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:15,110
Hello, Wise.

603
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:16,550
Come on and try it.

604
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,280
Try?

605
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:25,880
Aww, so adorable.

606
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:28,860
And capture.

607
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:30,750
Aww, it closed it's eyes.

608
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,410
Whateves, save it.

609
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:39,050
I've sorted the videotapes, including the ones that you have just returned.

610
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,610
We have enough videotapes to keep the business going for the time being, but in the long run we'll need more.

611
00:37:43,616 --> 00:37:46,330
We should consider getting some new stocks.

612
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,660
You guys are getting ready for new stocks?

613
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,340
That's great.

614
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,080
I've already watched every videotape in the store 10 times.

615
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,590
Oh, you are?

616
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:54,280
10 times?

617
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:57,210
It's me, Heddy, your super loyal customer.

618
00:37:57,216 --> 00:38:00,060
Aww, hello.

619
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:02,500
Did my controller just ran out of battery?

620
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,260
Luckily I got this one just as charged.

621
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:10,280
Just gotta dust it off and we'll be fine dandy.

622
00:38:10,283 --> 00:38:13,910
Ah, you guys really need some promotion at this stage.

623
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,380
I can help with that.

624
00:38:15,383 --> 00:38:18,190
I just realized I have no idea how to go about with it.

625
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,430
Don't sweat it, I'll show you how.

626
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:24,260
Now that we're back in business, let's get our tapes sorted.

627
00:38:24,266 --> 00:38:27,460
Let's start by picking some tapes for display.

628
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:32,000
Best choose the most popular genres to attract more customers.

629
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,400
This should be good.

630
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,880
This reflects the popularity of a videotape.

631
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:38,030
What do you mean?

632
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:40,060
Oh, the amount of money that we'll be getting.

633
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:40,980
Okay.

634
00:38:40,983 --> 00:38:43,780
Let's leave the promotions up to 18.

635
00:38:43,783 --> 00:38:45,330
And open for business.

636
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:47,310
Let's go, let's start shop.

637
00:38:47,316 --> 00:38:48,710
Every Denny counts.

638
00:38:48,716 --> 00:38:50,330
Yippee

639
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,930
We're gonna hold it off for the next stream because…

640
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:56,880
God knows how long I'm gonna be staying up if I'm gonna keep playing.

641
00:38:56,883 --> 00:39:00,060
So, we're gonna have another stream on another day.

642
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:03,830
With that said, thank you all so so so so much for watching.

643
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,930
Even if you're a VOD watcher, so be it.

644
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:08,930
That's fine, that's pretty cool.

645
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,300
Man, I've never felt so alive.

646
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,060
Getting back to livestream once more.

647
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:15,180
Be sure to subscribe, be sure to…

648
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:18,480
Whatever, hit the notification bell, do whatever the heck you want.

649
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:20,360
I'm gonna take my last sip of that…

650
00:39:20,366 --> 00:39:23,680
That soda water tea concoction.

651
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:24,630
Ugh.

652
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:26,080
Okay, so that's it.

653
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:30,930
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys next week.

654

656

Take care, take care, take care, take care, take care.

657
00:39:38,383 --> 00:39:40,180
Yeet.
