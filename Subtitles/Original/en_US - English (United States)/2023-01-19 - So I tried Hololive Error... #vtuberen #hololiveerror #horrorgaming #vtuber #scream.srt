Hey there, I got a lil something to show you.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,360
Stick around and then you tell me whether you like it or not.

3
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:08,500
So I bought this game called Hololive Error out of pure interest

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,750
and I figured why not make a stream out of it.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,380
Eyyyyy, hello hello!

6
00:00:14,383 --> 00:00:16,330
Y'all doing fine?

7
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,180
Well, I'm not sure about myself though.

8
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:20,180
I'm gonna be turning the lights off.

9
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:24,180
I have not streamed any horror games before but I wanna start somewhere.

10
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:25,430
Here goes nothing.

11
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:25,940
Begin.

12
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,330
For someone who has never really played horror games before, I'm sure you know how it went.

13
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:57,500
Thanks for your time.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,060
K thanks bye.

15
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:00,000
YEET!
