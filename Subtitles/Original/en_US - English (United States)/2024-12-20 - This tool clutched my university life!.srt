00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,040
There's something a familiar YouTuber once says.

2
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:06,360
USB.

3
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:09,110
Kon-Melo, it's ya Tech Wizardess girl, MeloriTensei.

4
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:13,060
And this right here is my personal USB

5
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:16,210
that has clutched me through all of university.

6
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,860
So if you're wondering what's inside this USB,

7
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:20,780
it contains a set of applications

8
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:24,330
that helped me through it because we got stupid thing called

9
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,710
university rules on the computer.

10
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:29,250
So what do you mean by that Mel?

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,390
Past Mel back in university, had to use computers

12
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,810
that were provided by the university in the computer lab

13
00:00:36,816 --> 00:00:38,310
and something like that.

14
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:41,110
Imagine this, like lil Mel's just walking around

15
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:45,980
and she needs to grab a quick file from say

16
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:48,030
a network attached storage from the university,

17
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:50,410
but it's only accessible by those computers.

18
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,710
So I got to grab those.

19
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:53,530
In theory, I would just grab the files,

20
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,950
take it to my laptop and do the work there.

21
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,030
But what if I'm just, all I'm doing is just editing a file

22
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,510
or something like a notepad or something like that.

23
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:03,780
And now I got to grab notes from say,

24
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:08,090
probably my student's website from their own servers,

25
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:10,810
like a school servers, something like that.

26
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:12,380
What if I want to do all that?

27
00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:13,060
Okay.

28
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:14,110
It should be pretty easy.

29
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,180
You remember the password, right?

30
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:18,080
Right?

31
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,680
Now this is where I hit a roadblock.

32
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:26,010
So it's 2020 at a time and people started adopting the use of something

33
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,810
we known as password managers.

34
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:32,540
So I started scrambling all my passwords and um,

35
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,060
lo and behold, it came biting at me

36
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:39,930
that I have to type every single passwords each time on those computers.

37
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:44,380
And I have to spend like probably what a whole minute to type my password down.

38
00:01:44,383 --> 00:01:45,760
Yeah, that's fucking insane.

39
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:47,110
Unfortunately, no.

40
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:49,130
Well, in case you're wondering what took a whole minute,

41
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,030
it's a 16 character passcode.

42
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:56,040
So not to mention you got case sensitivity, numbers, symbols,

43
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,280
they're all in factor.

44
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,830
So it took me that long to type.

45
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:00,760
Yeah.

46
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:04,060
Little man had to go like grab a keyboard and go,

47
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:06,930
Oh, let me just, uh, shift, percent,

48
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:09,330
uh, small T wait, no, go back.

49
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,280
A big T.

50
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:13,080
Yeah.

51
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,830
Um, that, that's kind of the problem I brand into.

52
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,260
And I didn't want to go through all that all the time,

53
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:20,830
because what if someone needs the computer really quickly

54
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,610
because there's a limited count of computers at some point,

55
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,930
or maybe I just want to be quick because I hate wasting time.

56
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:31,580
This, this USB has saved me for a very, very long time.

57
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:35,160
And it saved me a lot of times that I otherwise wouldn't have.

58
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,930
So let's have a look at what's inside.

59
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:39,910
Let's grab this and plug it in, I guess.

60
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,340
Oh, before I'm plugging it in, in case you're wondering,

61
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:43,590
I'm a big fan of tea.

62
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,560
This is just an off-topic stuff, but I kind of like to show, well...

63
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,060
Think about Craft Computing.

64
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:51,610
You know how Craft Computing always has a beer at the end of videos.

65
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:55,110
Well how about have a tea for myself?

66
00:02:55,116 --> 00:02:56,250
Ahmad tea.

67
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,330
Well, I'm just a big fan of drinking teas in general.

68
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:03,160
So, so this is just one of my choices of the moment

69
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:07,550
because I'm not too big of a person who buys a lot of tea at one time

70
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,210
and then drink them all at the same time.

71
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:12,910
I would be a psychopath if I'd be drinking that much.

72
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,130
But the boxes of tea that I currently have right now is

73
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,630
a chamomile lemongrass version.

74
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,330
And I gotta be honest, it's kind of very refreshing

75
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,260
and it gives you that calm vibes.

76
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:28,180
And while you're editing, it just brings you down to tranquility sometimes

77
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:29,530
while you're editing.

78
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:34,610
It's not so stressful and yeah, I guess I just enjoy it in general.

79
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:37,660
However, if you're wondering what's my top favorite tea,

80
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:41,330
it would be the Taiwanese High Mountain Oolongs.

81
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,310
Those give a serious massive punch.

82
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:46,580
It's kind of like an alternative to coffee

83
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,610
where the coffee gives you the energy punch

84
00:03:48,616 --> 00:03:50,190
except in tea form.

85
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:53,980
So that's kind of how I feel about Taiwanese High Mountain.

86
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,050
Right, all the tea yapping out of the way,

87
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,960
let's get back to the main part of the video.

88
00:03:57,966 --> 00:03:59,110
EEEEGH!

89
00:03:59,116 --> 00:03:59,710
dadun~

90
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:01,530
da-DON~

91
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:06,910
Right, I got my USB plugged in and let's see what's inside.

92
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:10,530
Oh, um, there's nothing here.

93
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:11,780
Right.

94
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:15,000
If you know me as a person who does a lot of experiments with tech,

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,710
you know that I tend to clean up my USB a lot.

96
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,130
Yeah, um, those are one of those days, you know.

97
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:24,100
That means I think I probably have lost everything.

98
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,160
Well fear no more!

99
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,760
We could probably just minimize that

100
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,510
and open up the very program that we need.

101
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:31,130
It's called PortableApps.

102
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:36,160
So PortableApps.com allows you to have portable versions of your favorite apps

103
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,190
in the USB or whatever hard drive you're going to carry around.

104
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,810
It's basically meant to be like a mini program of your choice wherever you go.

105
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:47,910
It works on drives, it works on clouds, it works on anything,

106
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,410
it works on, well, anything you can put it in, it works.

107
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,480
With a small little caveat,

108
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:56,680
I've only had prior experience with the Windows version of the app,

109
00:04:56,683 --> 00:05:01,110
so I can't really tell you anything about the Linux version or the Mac version

110
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:06,310
because they say it also works with it via crossover, WineSkin, WineBottler, PlayOnMac.

111
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:09,310
So your mileage may vary when you're on those platforms.

112
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:11,010
However, we're gonna get into here

113
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:14,000
and we're gonna start with downloading PortableApps.com

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,910
and soon enough, we're gonna have an installer.

115
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,160
After some time...

116
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,760
So once you're done, open up the installer as per usual and...

117
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:26,010
Oh look, Mallory is British.

118
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:30,080
Hahahahah, get the goofy ahh reference? No? Yeah... I know...

119
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:35,890
Okay, right, let's click on next and agree to the terms and yada yada yada.

120
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:41,730
And what we're gonna do is click on a new copy, a new installation,

121
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,600
and it's gonna ask you what type of installation you're gonna put it in,

122
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,510
in a cloud, in a portable, or like local, all users, or anywhere you want.

123
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,890
We're gonna pick portable.

124
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:55,410
And it's gonna ask you which drive, which in our case would be the D drive.

125
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,510
Haha, D.

126
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:57,830
Alright, let's press install.

127
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,580
Now we're gonna wait for it to finish installing.

128
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:04,430
And then following that, it's gonna ask if you wanna run the program.

129
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:07,160
And once you start, it opens up something like this.

130
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,180
You got the about page, and then you got something

131
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:13,710
that looks a little awfully like Windows 7 kind of start menu,

132
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:16,060
except everything PortableApps related.

133
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:18,380
I'm gonna close that for now because what we're gonna do

134
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:20,250
is we're gonna go to, oh,

135
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,630
it has done it for us.

136
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,210
I was gonna click on it but it didn't, it didn't let me,

137
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:27,010
it just opened it up itself.

138
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:30,260
Right, so we're gonna start grabbing things that we want.

139
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,530
So say for example I want my Chrome and Firefox,

140
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:37,660
so we just go scrolling through the list and uh, internet.

141
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,300
We got Firefox Portable right here, we just tick that,

142
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,880
and then say um, I probably want something like

143
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:48,860
Telegram desktop if you happen to use Telegram,

144
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,030
and download whatever you want.

145
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:54,050
There's even OBS Studio as well, that's surprising.

146
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,610
And if you need VLC, they, they do have VLC.

147
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:03,230
So you can see that there's a massive choice of applications that you can use,

148
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:06,430
however I did not use all of them unfortunately.

149
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:09,480
I did use a few, particularly Firefox.

150
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:10,780
And I think that's pretty much it.

151
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:14,760
Otherwise, it's kind of like my utility USB if anything.

152
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:18,160
But yeah, with that said, I'm gonna show you what I actually have,

153
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,460
because I fucking lied to you in the beginning.

154
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:26,030
I did not wipe my drive without knowing that, that I have my shit there.

155
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,630
I have backed it all up.

156
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:32,000
So I'm gonna bring them all back and then I'm gonna present to you what I got.

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,030
Right, so I've opened up my, my particular copy of PortableApps, and um,

158
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:40,390
well it's been quite a while since I last updated anything,

159
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,380
so there's some updates that it automatically came up as I opened it up.

160
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,310
So let's press install on those.

161
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:48,130
So it does most of it for you,

162
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:54,110
however there are times where they will ask you to confirm your agreement to the EULA,

163
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:59,030
because some apps require you to agree to the EULA before proceeding.

164
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:03,730
So this process of installing apps are not 100% unattended,

165
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,750
some of which requires your EULA attention.

166
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,430
So please take note of that.

167
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:11,930
So um, if you're planning on doing anything else while you're installing,

168
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:15,440
please make sure to check back on your computer when you're doing that.

169
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:18,560
Some more time later...

170
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:21,430
Right, with the update done, I'm gonna click finish,

171
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:24,230
and we can bring back our things.

172
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:29,480
And now, I'm not sure if you can imagine what kind of person I am, but…

173
00:08:29,483 --> 00:09:11,630
(Boss music INTENSIFIES)

174
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:15,130
Yeah, um, I've downloaded everything.

175
00:09:15,183 --> 00:09:18,310
To the point that, when I click this button,

176
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:21,830
I'm only left with 3 programs to download brand new.

177
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,600
I'll take care of that off camera.

178
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,230
But what's more important is that you can fit a lot of programs.

179
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,950
There's about over 50 gigs, just programs only.

180
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,580
That's freaking insane.

181
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:39,310
It's like, you can just grab a 64 gig USB and throw everything on it,

182
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:44,180
and booyah, you got yourself a hyper-utility USB for anything.

183
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:48,310
Like tech support for your grandma, tech support for yourself,

184
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:52,140
or a quick emergency schoolwork by borrowing someone's PC

185
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:56,060
and then not installing it onto their computer so you can use your own.

186
00:09:56,066 --> 00:10:00,180
There's so many different things you can do with it, and there's everything.

187
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,460
Like Notepad++,

188
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:07,060
they got even LibreOffice as well, so you can do some of the office works.

189
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:11,950
It's just super, super flexible as a program.

190
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:17,260
And if you feel like it, you could probably also install your own portable apps

191
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,530
and chuck it into the apps folder,

192
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,180
but I'm not really too sure how that works

193
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:25,060
because I installed an older version of OBS and threw it in,

194
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:27,200
and it somehow showed up for me.

195
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,130
But not in my current case, but it did show up in the older case.

196
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:34,610
Not sure about today though, however, but your mileage may vary.

197
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:38,230
So this thing, considering being portable,

198
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:42,630
which also means that if you load Firefox on it, it's not gonna save into AppData,

199
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,780
it saves into its local folder as well,

200
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:47,880
so that means I could also save my password managers in there,

201
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:51,380
and I could get stuff copied and pasted very quickly

202
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:54,630
without having to worry about needing to install another program.

203
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:58,210
Uh, but Mel, doesn't that mean you're installing a program

204
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:01,530
or using a third-party program on a computer?

205
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:04,200
Technically, it's using third-party programs,

206
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,680
however, in my university, it said nothing about installing anything,
(Correction: What I meant is that it said nothing about...)

207
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:11,160
so I technically didn't install anything to the computer.
("running third party programs" just "installing" is no-no..)

208
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:15,060
I've only installed it to my USB for use on the USB,

209
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:19,060
and I'm only piggybacking the processing power from the desktop

210
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:20,910
that the university provided,

211
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,380
which technically, I'm still in the right of doing that.

212
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:30,450
But yeah, this is how this one tool has clutched my entire university life.

213
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,130
You may wonder to yourself, why don't you just bring your own laptop?

214
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,810
Well that's because my laptop battery was dead at the time.

215
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:43,280
Yeah, um, about that, um, you can see where I was going with that.

216
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:47,060
But yeah, I don't think there's much for me to yap about and show about,

217
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:50,930
but it is something that I would like to show and tell and yap about

218
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:53,480
primarily because I think it's worth showing

219
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:56,350
and it's kind of a cool concept in my opinion.

220
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,200
So that's pretty much it.

221
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,130
With that said, thank you all so much for watching.

222
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:03,350

Want more tech videos?

224
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:05,710
Check out my videos tab.

226
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:11,460
And um, if you want to hang out with me, check out the discord,

227
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:14,700
and we probably talk about a lot of different stuff and stuff like that.

228
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,350
If you would like to support me financially, check out my Ko-fi

229
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,130
because none of these, like the computer I'm using, the equipment I'm using is free,

230
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:27,310
so hopefully we can be financially sustainable to be able to maintain

231
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:29,960
all these hardware that I'm currently using for filming.

232
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:32,130
But anyways, with that said, thank you all so much for watching,

233
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:34,110
and OtsuMelo deshita (It's been ya girl, Mel).

234
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:35,610
See ya!

235
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:40,110
Have a good day or night or whatever the time zone is at your place.

236
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:42,660
See ya!

240
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,660
UGH UGH UGH UGH I almost dropped that fucking camera.

241
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,640
HAHAHAHA

242
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:14,180
I'm not dropping that camera ever again.
