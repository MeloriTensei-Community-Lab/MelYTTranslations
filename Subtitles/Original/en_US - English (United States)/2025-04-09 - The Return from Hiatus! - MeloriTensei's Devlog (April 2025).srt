1
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:08,830
You were expecting something a little different?

2
00:00:10,016 --> 00:00:12,300
Huh, who could have thought?

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,380
You seriously think something is going to be a little different in this very video?

4
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:22,300
Well, you may be a little right because…

5
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:24,520
UGH!

6
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:31,400
It's time for a devlog!

[MeloriTensei 転性メロリ]
Devlog April 2025 - Returning from Hiatus

8
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:38,630
Ah~ It's been quite a while.

9
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:39,780
Welcome!

10
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:42,770
Kon-Melo, it's ya Tech Wizardess girl, MeloriTensei.

11
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:47,720
And I gotta be honest, I don't really have much planned for this devlog video.

12
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:49,870
But there is something a little different.

13
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:51,980
So let's get straight into it.

14
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:56,880
But first up, as you can tell I'm very unprepared, let me get my script real quick.

15
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:57,920
One second.

16
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:01,400
Alright, um, script number one…

17
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,230
No that's not it, that's not it.

18
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:05,330
That's certainly not it.

19
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,700
Ah yes.

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,230
Oh yes, this might be it.

21
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,820
This might not be it.

22
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:11,620
Oh shit, this may be it.

23
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:13,300
No this might not be it.

24
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:14,230
This may be it.

25
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,520
No this might not be it!

26

(Mel PANIK)

27
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,570
Are we good yet?

28
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,650
Now I'm gonna start off with answering the question,

29
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,280
why the hell am I standing so freaking far away from the camera?

30
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:30,350
That's primarily because I kinda wanna show you this full body tracker

31
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:31,970
that I actually used

32
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,900
as opposed to the one that I made about the Slime VR video.

33
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,720
So this one is a little more fully functional

34
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:42,120
and I can kinda move my elbows around,

35
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:45,830
though it is a little laggy because of the wifi environment here.

36
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,870
But it is functional, rest assured.

37
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:53,030
This is what some bits of my own pocket money went to

38
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,770
since the past devlog.

39
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:57,720
And I gotta be honest, I may be a little bit proud of that,

40
00:01:57,716 --> 00:01:59,530
I may not be a little bit proud of that

41
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,350
because there's occasional yaw

42
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:03,920
that you might see back in the Beat Saber stream.

43
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,680
Aside from setup upgrades, what do you think?

44
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:08,730
Do you think this microphone is so much better?

45
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:10,070
Do you think it sounds way better?

46
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,980
Because I got myself a new microphone.

47
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:14,570
And I'm not too sure where I'm gonna put the microphone

48
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:16,900
because currently it's clipped up to my shirt 

49
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,530
but I don't think it's actually picking up the best of my voice.

50
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:23,770
It sounds a little far away from my own monitoring.

51
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:27,080
And yeah, I think there's more improvements to be done.

52
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,170
Let me show you how it actually sounds when you put it up close.

53
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,880
So it actually sounds far better when you put it up close.

54
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:36,450
But yeah, once I think of a better place to put the microphone,

55
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:40,230
I can assure you that this is going to sound way, way, way better.

56
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:44,320
Now if you've been observant with some of my videos lately,

57
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:47,000
things have been a little sloppy here and there.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,920
And it's going up, it's going down.

59
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,880
The editing has been a little lackluster.

60
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:55,520
And the New Year's Eve video was a little rushed.

61
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:58,120
So with that said, I'm gonna be announcing

62
00:02:58,116 --> 00:03:00,780
that I'm moving away from scheduled videos.

63
00:03:00,783 --> 00:03:03,470
So videos are no longer on schedule.

64
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,500
And I'm gonna be pushing the videos out

65
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,120
however I like, whenever I like.

66
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:10,170
Albeit with a bit of delay

67
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,530
so that we have Ko-fi members watching it as early access.

68
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:17,270
However, there is still one scheduled content you can expect from me,

69
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:18,880
that is weekly streams.

70
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:21,580
Streams are still going on a weekly basis.

71
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,530
It's just that videos are not weekly anymore.

72
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,480
So you might expect some videos in probably a week,

73
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:29,580
some videos in a couple of weeks,

74
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,970
some maybe even a month.

75
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:32,580
I'm not too sure, but

76
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,950
I'm terribly sorry I can't upkeep a weekly scheduled basis

77
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,300
because it's been really heavy for me.

78
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,830
By the time you watch this video, it might very well be April.

79
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:45,030
And I'm gonna make it clear, this video is recorded during March.
(2025 March 29th)

80
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:48,470
So you can tell why I've been very struggling

81
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:49,800
with my upload schedule these days.

82
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,370
So I hope I can bring the quality back up

83
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,000
to what you guys remember of

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,370
when I first popped off during the Pixel OS video.

85
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:59,080
Right, onto the bigger top news.

86
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,880
But first, let me get over there.

87
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:02,250
So I've been wanting to make my videos

88
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,200
a whole lot more accessible lately.

89
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,400
And I thought to myself, let's start with closed captions.

90
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,620
So you can probably see most of my videos that are public

91
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:13,720
are now closed captioned by yours truly.

92
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:17,820
And I realize something's a little not enough.

93
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:21,320
You can tell that auto-translate is not doing justice
(I did technically typed "they" in English.)

94
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:22,770
for some of the languages. 
(But Auto Translate can't tell the singular form of "they")

95
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:26,370
So I'm proud to announce that I'm going to be opening up

96
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:31,120
a GitHub repo specifically for fans to submit translations 

97
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:33,900
to my subtitles and my titles and descriptions.

98
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:38,230
So anyone, hopefully, can enjoy my videos the way it's intended to.

99
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,530
Now knowing it's a GitHub repository,

100
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:43,830
things may be a little shaky and a little bit unstable.

101
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,430
So it may be very well unpolished.

102
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:49,620
So I hope for more cooperation from fellow translators

103
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:51,800
and we grow as we go.

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,120
As time passes.

105
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:56,570
(Ding dong)
Oh, hold on. Someone's at the door.

106
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:57,470
Oh, hi.

107
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:59,480
Yes, yes, yes.

108
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:01,220
Yes, it's me.

109
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:02,730
Thank you so much.

110
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,630
(Grunt)

111
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:07,330
I'll get to you later.

112
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm back.

113
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,630
I'm back with something new in the package in the mail.

114
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:14,670
So I got myself a brand new capture card

115
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,270
so I can record more HDMI content.

116
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:19,720
So probably a test device

117
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:22,330
that I can probably test Linux in or something like that.

118
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,900
Or maybe console games or something like that.

119
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,430
That's primarily because my old capture card is insanely old

120
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:33,170
to the point that it is just so plain freaking bad.

121
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,900
I have driver issues with it.

122
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,730
I've had OBS issues of it.

123
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:39,080
I've had straight up capturing issues of it.

124
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,900
And check this out on the screen.

125
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:43,850
This is the starking difference that you'll find

126
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,120
out of between the two capture cards.

127
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:48,300
So the new capture card that I'm going to be having

128
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,980
is the Elgato Game Capture Neo.

129
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,870
And my old capture card was the AverMedia Live Gamer Portable.

130
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:57,080
And if you look at the difference,
(After extended recording, the old AverMedia capture card lags) 

131
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,170
the compression and the quality,
(Btw, both cards recorded from a splitter in real time)

132
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,880
it's such a stark difference.

133
00:06:00,883 --> 00:06:04,620
So this is another investment out of my own pocket

134
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:07,280
that I am going to make for MeloriTensei.

135
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,430
Now with investment comes cost cutting.

136
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,500
So I'm moving away from self hosting

137
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,970
and I'm no longer hosting my own page

138
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:19,630
on a self hosted server called PinCushion that I came up myself.

139
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:21,120
Of course the base is Linkstack,

140
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:23,130
but I did call it PinCushion back then.

141
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,880
However, it comes with great sad news

142
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:26,580
that PinCushion has to go down

143
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:30,630
because I've not been able to maintain the 99% uptime

144
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,680
that most outside servers can.

145
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:37,830
In fact, it may very well be 70% or even 60% or 50% downtime,

146
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,670
which is freaking insane.

147
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,830
There's no way you can keep up a website that little

148
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,670
and expect people to check out your links from there.

149
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,380
So I've decided to move back to Carrd

150
00:06:47,383 --> 00:06:50,770
and be back confined with the 50 element limit.

151
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:52,770
But hey, I tried and I did it.

152
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:54,280
What do you guys think of the design?

153
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:56,070
Let me know in the comments.

154
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,920
And on another great news.

155
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:58,820
Oh, what's this?

156
00:06:58,816 --> 00:06:59,980
Hold on.

157
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:02,470
Wow, this world is very packed of features.

158
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:03,580
What the heck?

159
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,600
I didn't think it would be that useful.

160
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,480
Wow.

161
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:07,380
Check this out.

162
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:09,200
This is super cool.

163
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,500
You can go...
(Light switch clicks)

164
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,630
Ah, help!
(Light switch clicks again)

165
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:12,630
(...)

166
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,630
We're good.

167
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:20,130
Here's a little tissue for you guys.

169
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,320
Anyways, jokes aside, um,

170
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:26,000
fellow donators of Throne and soon to be YouTube members,

171
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,220
stay tuned for an upcoming stream

172
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:31,580
because I got something a little different for you guys on that stream.

173
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,630
So be sure to keep an eye on

174
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:37,770
the very specific stream title that you usually find for VTubers.

175
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:40,570
So with that, we're going to have basic emotes to start out,

176
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:43,780
and I'm not sure if there'll be member exclusive content

177
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:44,780
in the future,

178
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:46,380
 but I can assure you that

179
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,770
there isn't much exclusive content to make 

180
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:50,950
to justify just yet.

181
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:52,580
So you won't find much exclusive content

182
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,150
aside from early access content at the moment.

183
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,600
But if you support me more of that,

184
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,430
we could probably produce something that

185
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:02,220
normally is not okay to put out on public YouTube,

186
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,180
or you just want something extra out of me 

187
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:09,500
because it's often you, you, you, you, you, the members

188
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,020
that make it happen.

189
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:14,820
So thank you all so, so, so, so, so much

190
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:17,870
for making my content creation life less miserable

191
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:20,450
and allowing me to pull things off like this.

192
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:22,980
Now I can't really do things like Filian can.

193
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:24,130
Let me try jumping.

194
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:25,450
Uagh!

195
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:27,320
Whoa.

196
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:30,080
Did that actually... woah!

197
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay.

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,470
I think I see a potential.

199
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:35,020
Speaking of something potential, I got something in my room.

200
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,380
I got to grab it real quick.

201
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,330
Oh my God, this room looks a little adorable.

202
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,730
Holy crap. Look at this.

203
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:44,180
This room's got this thing.

204
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:48,020
(Intensely breathing)

205
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:48,900
Okay. Okay.

206
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:49,930
We got to put it aside.

207
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:52,380
This is not part of the announcement.

208
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:54,930
Oh, that was scary.

209
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:55,880
Right.

210
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:58,920
Where is it?

211
00:08:58,916 --> 00:08:59,980
Ah, I found it.

212
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:03,600
Let me just put that on and put this on.

213
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,870
Tell me if you know something is a little different.

214
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,300
Something's a little different?

215
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,000
That's right.

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I got myself a new witch hat.

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,120
So streams from now on, you'll be able to see this new witch hat.

218
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:16,020
Guys, check this out.

219
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:19,130
There's also a new trans badge on my dress as well.

220
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:22,120
Now it's far easier for people to know that I'm trans.

221
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:23,520
Now as for justification to

222
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:26,530
why I'm adding a witch hat and a trans badge on my dress,

223
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,820
that's primarily because

224
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:31,200
I've realized I'm starting to have some form of identity crisis.

225
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,520
So you've seen the logo on my channel

226
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:34,920
and my channel description,

227
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,900
and you might have a second to think to yourself.

228
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,830
"Huh..."

229
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,120
"Tech wizardess, but she's not wearing a witch hat."

230
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,280
That's because for quite a long time,

231
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:48,500
I have not been able to find a witch hat asset

232
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,020
that suits my needs.

233
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:53,000
One that is easy to rig into without much effort

234
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,330
because I don't really have much time to do it.

235
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,280
And as you can clearly tell, it doesn't really swing or bounce.

236
00:09:58,283 --> 00:09:59,820
It's just attached to my head.

237
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,570
That's pretty much most of what I need, honestly.

238
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:04,520
It's kind of like an identity thing.

239
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:08,050
And I've also had people getting mildly irritated

240
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:10,230
simply because they don't know I'm trans.

241
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,820
And yes, welcome.

242
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:13,200
I'm Melori Valentine.

243
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,800
I go by she/her pronouns.

244
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,200
And here, I made it very clear.

245
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,780
Very very clear, in fact.

246
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:21,830
So hopefully this helps me down in the long run.

247
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,630
But yeah.

248
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,830
And speaking of down the long run,

249
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,980
there are two backlog videos that are due to release

250
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:30,800
someday in the future after this very video.

251
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,200
And also, a secret video incoming.

252
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,280
Stay tuned for that.

253
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:35,870
I'm not sure when it's going to come out,

254
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:38,100
but it will come out in distant future.

255
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,570
Don't hold your breath for a few months,

256
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:42,100
but it will come out when that time is right.

257
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,980
But yeah, with that said,

258
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:45,880
thank you all so so so so so much for watching.

259
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:49,600
I'm so so so sorry for this four months long hiatus.

260
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,570
And I've been gone for way too long than anyone's comfortable with.

261
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:55,130
And I hope there's far less delays in this.

262
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,730
And I hope to make way more content.

263
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,100
Now with new equipment, with new morale,

264
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,430
hopefully, for the new years.

265
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:04,550
So with that said, it's been a great honor

266
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:06,820
for me to today say, OtsuMelo deshita. (It's been ya girl Mel)

267
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:10,050
See ya in the next stream and video.

268
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:13,370
See ya!

269
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,750
Woo~

270
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,080

[MeloriTensei 転性メロリ] Thank you for watching!
Check out my other contents!

272
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:37,870
You still here?

273
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:39,100
Cool. Hehehe.

274
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,170
Here's something extra.

275
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,680
I screwed up the rigging a little bit.

276
00:11:41,683 --> 00:11:46,370
So my face now makes faces when I point that stuff here,

277
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:50,400
which is why I don't make hand gestures in this hand on this model.

278
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,370
I made all my hand gestures here because of this reason.

279
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:58,420
Or I just opened my hands like the Mr. Beast meme.
Announcer: Mr. Beast!!!

280
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,270
I'm sorry.

281
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:01,070
I'm sorry guys. Heheheh

282
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,850
This might be another jankily recorded session,

283
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,830
but I hope you guys don't mind.

284
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,030
See you guys.

285
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:09,770
Pat pat pat pat pat pat.
