1
00:00:00,483 --> 00:00:02,460
Oh God.

2
00:00:02,566 --> 00:00:04,700
(Clapboard claps)

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,780
(Mousemat slaps on the floor)

4
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:08,510
Fuck.

5
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:10,680
(Mousemat slaps on the floor again)

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,460
God damn it.

7
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:15,000
[VTuber washes her stinky mousemat]

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,430
poopy

9
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,050
Kon-Melo, it's your girl MeloriTensei

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,890
and as of recording this video the PC is currently down

11
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:27,480
and I've sent it to a repair shop for repair

12
00:00:27,483 --> 00:00:33,110
and I'm hoping to see it come back completely recovered

13
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:40,110
and hopefully, I don't feel as devastated about whatever fatal crash happened

14
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:44,290
during the Zenless Zone Zero stream, but for now

15
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:45,250
While the PC's gone,

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,780
I decided to do stuff that I had otherwise not been able to do

17
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:51,110
because I've not been free lately

18
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:53,290
So, here's one of the things.

19
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:54,510
(Mousemat flaps while being moved)

20
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:57,530
Get the fuck over there.

21
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,560
We're cleaning my mouse mat.

22
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:01,600
To those cheeky little boys out there,

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,910
sorry, no feet pics.

24
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,030
I got my tights on. Hehehehe.

25
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:10,630
However, we're just gonna have a little chill vlog

26
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:16,580
(Plastic stool clops)
Have a little sit down and just clean away at the mouse mat,

27
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,840
but before we do.

28
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:19,630
(Bucket lands on mat)

29
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:23,210
We need a bucket and we gotta get ourselves some soap

30
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:27,230
(Laundry powder dropping into bucket and onto mousemat)

31
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:29,330
'right, without further ado, let's get some liquids onto it

32
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,410
so we can start scrubbing away

33
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,590
Maybe we can have a little short talk about this

34
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,010
(Drops scrubber onto mousemat)

35
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:40,680
(Water sprays into bucket and onto mousemat)

36
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,860
Now to some of you who are wondering

37
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:44,330
Gee, Mel, you're wearing tights.

38
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:47,250
Why the hell are you wearing tights in the bathroom?

39
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,310
Well, that's because I fucking like to.

40
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:53,360
Now on to the second question, why the hell am I wearing gloves?

41
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:55,430
That's because I fucking want to.

42
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:58,280
I don't care if I'm gonna need to wash it after this video.

43
00:01:58,283 --> 00:01:59,260
I just like to put them on

44
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,660
because I can't give two flippin fucks about this.

45
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,960
So let's get it soaked in

46
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:07,880
Ahh~, my gloves are wet. Hehe.

47
00:02:07,883 --> 00:02:10,880
Whatever, we'll get to scrubbing anyway.

48
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:11,880
Here goes nothing.

49
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:15,310
(Scrubbing noises)

50
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:19,530
So I want to start from here going all the way to that side.

51
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,800
I'll probably answer some Q&A's

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,760
Well, as I'm in the middle of scrubbing...

53
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:27,260
(Scrubbing noises)

54
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:32,340
(Sped up scrubbing noises)

55
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:34,460
Alright, let's start with the first question

56
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:38,880
To those who are wondering, what the hell actually happened to the PC,

57
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:40,780
during the Zenless Zone Zero stream.

58
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:45,930
So to answer that question, it all started with possibly a hardware error.

59
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:49,430
But what happened is that the screen kind of just blacked out

60
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:54,260
(Take note that the Power LED is still on)
but the PC stayed on and I had no idea what's going on

61
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:59,050
(but the whole PC is off)
because when I got back to check the event viewer,

62
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,880
nothing came up and it kind of got me in the panic

63
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,830
because I don't know what could possibly be a problem.

64
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:15,180
(More sped up scrubbing)

65
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:17,840
Eugh...

66
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:20,510
(Imitating the meme) Brother, eugh... (laugh)

67
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:30,110
(Even more sped up scrubbing)

68
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:34,580
Oh my god, the more I scrub towards this side, where my hand is at,

69
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,610
it's getting dirtier and dirtier

70
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,860
Jesus fucking Christ.

71
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:45,750
I really wished I hadn't waited this crazy long just to scrub my mouse mat.

72
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:57,860
(Sped up scrubbing again)

73
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:00,360
I wish you could see the state of this, Jesus Christ.

74
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,680
This is an abomination.

75
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:05,510
Right. So as I was saying,

76
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:08,180
so I had no other options that I thought to myself:

77
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:10,460
"Okay, it's about time

78
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:14,880
I give the diagnostic work to a third-party technician."

79
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:17,760
Even if it means breaking my bank once again.

80
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:21,080
As you may know as a struggling creator,

81
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:26,260
I don't really have much money and I'm heavily still relying on the donators' money.

82
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:33,060
So, special thanks to my Ko-fi one-off donators, Mint and Canadian

83
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:38,560
and also my brand new first-ever Ko-fi member, Jo.

84
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:41,230
Thank you so so so much for your donations.

85
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:45,310
If anything, I greatly appreciate your donations.

86
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:47,680
So on the story about the technician,

87
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:49,960
I thought to myself "how hard can it be?"

88
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:52,250
They have plenty of spare parts to try this on

89
00:04:52,250 --> 00:05:08,680
(Sped up scrubbing xN I lost count)

90
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,680
I told the technician the full story about what happened to the PC

91
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:14,830
and whatever happened prior to it.

92
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,250
The technician told me his estimation

93
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,930
is that this may take extremely long to diagnose.

94
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:25,810
Considering how this is the second ever rarest case

95
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:28,880
that this technician shop has ever suffered.

96
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:32,730
And the shop I have been to is not just any other shop

97
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,330
that is just like in the corner of some alleyways.

98
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:41,780
It is a shop with a pretty good integrity and really high reputation.

99
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:45,360
So, considering how they've worked with a whole lot of PCs

100
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:50,030
and yet this is the second ever most difficult case ever.

101
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:54,510
I knew I'm gonna be in for such a wild ride for a PC diagnosis like this.

102
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:57,260
But still I told the technician:

103
00:05:57,266 --> 00:06:00,730
"do whatever it takes and just give me the answer"

104
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:04,330
I'm not looking for repairs yet because I don't got the money for repairs

105
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,300
But for you viewers, if you're sympathetic for me

106
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,880
and you want to see more pretty good content from me

107
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:12,610
that's based on what you saw on my previous content.

108
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:17,210
Feel free to check out my Ko-fi for membership or one-off donations.

109
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:19,890
Feel free to do any any of the either.

110
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:22,480
You'd be greatly appreciated because I'll be spending those money

111
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:26,830
on possibly replacing the parts first so I can hang on to it

112
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,630
and actually do proper content.

113
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,660
So I can make contents that

114
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:35,610
where you guys can determine whether it's actually worth the money

115
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:37,760
to actually donate to me in the future.

116
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:54,910
(Sanic speed scrubbing)

117
00:06:54,916 --> 00:07:00,360
To the fellow existing viewers who have noticed my series of yap-a-thons on Discord,

118
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:05,500
I hope you don't feel too disturbed by the messages I posted on Discord.

119
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,710
At that time, I was really really on a dark place

120
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:12,780
because I thought "the PC is dead and it's over", that kind of feeling

121
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:16,800
because the PC to me is like one of my closest sidekicks ever

122
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,230
and the PC to me is kind of like my entire life to me.

123
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,280
So it was a little bit hard to accept

124
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:27,330
that the PC really is "sick" and it really has to go to the "hospital".

125
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:33,190
So, it took me tons of courage to actually take it to get a diagnosis.

126
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,880
So as of filming, it has been days since I sent it.

127
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:38,960
So, all the best for it, I guess.

128
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:48,210
(Scrubbing goes brr...)

129
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:49,810
(Slowly scrubbing in One Direction)

130
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:50,410
(You're insecure~)

131
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,710
(Slowly scrubbing in one direction)

132
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:56,730
All right, we've done plenty of scrubbing.

133
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:57,980
Let's give it a little slap.

134
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:00,030
(Mousemat plops)

135
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,060
Well, that wasn't as satisfying, isn't it?

136
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,530
(Wringing my gloves)

137
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:07,030
Ooh, that was soaking.

138
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:08,440
'Right, let's give it a rinse.

139
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:23,910
(Sped up rinsing the mousemat)

140
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:24,860
All right.

141
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:27,610
(Remaining water dripping onto the mousemat)

142
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:32,200
(Now on the floor, hah...)

143
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,380
Oh my god, look at how soaked it is.

144
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:38,710
I can't really show just yet. But...

145
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:41,180
Right, let's hang it up to dry.

146
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:43,860
Hey, don't tell me you haven't seen feet before.

147
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:47,700
You're not a real OG if you haven't seen my skirt video.

148
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,230
(Wringing the mousemat and dripping onto the floor)

149
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:50,950
Oh, fuck me...

150
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,130
Crazy soaked.

151
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,810
Ah, I'm gonna spend a lot of time trying to clean this up.

152
00:08:56,816 --> 00:09:00,380
Whatever, job done is a job well done.

153
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:02,540
(Wringing my gloves)

154
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,760
Right, let's get 'er up to dry

155
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:09,510
and we'll see if it still has any of these disgusting things

156
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,630
on my mouse mat after that.

157
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:14,180
Let's skip forward to when it's dry.

158
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:15,200
(Feeling the mousemat)

159
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,780
All right, there we have it.

160
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:20,210
'right let's get the keyboard over here.

161
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:22,600
Voilà!

162
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,750
Clean mouse mat.

163
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,230
Don't mind whatever that is. Um...

164
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,830
I got something a little sticky on that.

165
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,960
So I've screwed up.

166
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:34,060
That's not coming off anytime soon. Ehehehe.

167
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,710
Right, let's get some random sharp object.

168
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:38,110
Like say my microphone (jack).

169
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:40,630
(Light scoring on the mousemat)

170
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,010
Check that out.

171
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:47,250
Absolutely no dirt on the prominent areas like the mouse.

172
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,290
Albeit, there's a little bit wrinkling here, but don't worry about that.

173
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,850
I'll try ironing that out.

174
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,360
But yeah, there we go.

00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:57,110
We got a clean set up once more.

176
00:09:57,116 --> 00:09:58,810
Anyways, thank you guys so much for watching.

177
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:03,100

178
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,930
And if you like it, please do financially support me.

179
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:09,950
I really do need to get back on the video journey

180
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:14,510
and possibly more live streams and hopefully to continue to entertain you

181
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:18,360
without having to worry about cash flows and money and stuff.

182
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:21,640
So with that said I'll see you guys nex-

183

184
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:28,230
Huh, who is that?

185
00:10:28,516 --> 00:10:31,330
I wonder who could that be...
(Ominous music)

186
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,680
(Door opens)

187
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
