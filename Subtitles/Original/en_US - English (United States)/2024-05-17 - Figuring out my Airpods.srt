1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,960
AirPods.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,240
That's right, in case you were 
wondering, I was a former Apple user.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,520
Even though I still use the iPhone 12 Pro Max, the 
AirPods is a pretty disappointing device for me.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,520
Because in my personal opinion, it sounds 
pretty good, but not for its price.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,160
The only reason why I held on to a pair of AirPods

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,760
is primarily because I used to have 
issues having earbuds in my ear.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,080
So if you know these kinds of in-ear earphones 
that we all currently know and actively use,

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,960
I have severe issues getting either 
of them into my teeny tiny ear canal

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,120
that would just make these earphones slip out,

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,080
which is pretty fucking sad for me.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,520
And lucky for me, a pair of AirPods still has 
these classic designs that are not in-ear,

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,040
which is also why I picked up a pair of 
AirPods 3rd gen instead of the AirPods Pro 2.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,120
Now recently, I've ran into a problem.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,880
The AirPods are crackling.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,520
The AirPods made a crackling noise, 
and I don't know where it came from.

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,400
All I know is that whenever 
I play some bassy noises,

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,680
it starts making serious level crackling noises.

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,200
And since I'm already using my 
iPhone as my tracking camera,

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,920
there are no other better device that 
I can use to illustrate this problem.

20
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:14,400
Look who's back.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
Now if you've seen my previous AOSP video,

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,800
you would know that I announced that

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,120
I'm going to daily drive 
crDroid as my primary firmware.

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,434
And ever since then, I've started doing a 
lot of tweaking to suit a certain theme.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,920
That's right, it's Ruby Rose from RWBY.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,440
Now you may be wondering to yourself,

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,640
why the hell am I using an Android 
phone to illustrate the problem?

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,080
The truth of the matter is, I don't give a damn.

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,280
Or more accurately, I do not 
have any other Apple devices.

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,600
So to solve this problem, I've 
got an AirPods companion app.

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,040
And thanks to our great 
sponsor at Darken Development

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,940
for making my content creation possible.

33
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,920
So if you've heard of my 
sponsors for the past two videos,

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,920
particularly the Skirt video and the AOSP video,

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,160
then you would know that SD 
Maid SE is a great junk cleaner.

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,560
Now this time, I'd like to 
have a little plot twist.

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,640
Since we're talking about the AirPods,

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,960
I'm going to promote his other app, CAPod instead.

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,640
So CAPod is basically Darken's AirPods companion 
that you can use alongside your AirPods.

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Though because of Apple's limitation, you 
can't really do much, but let's be real.

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,160
Whatever this app can't do, other apps can't do.

42
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,080
So this means the CarPod app is one of the 
best AirPods companion that I've ever seen.

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,360
Now let's just start illustrating 
this idea real quick.

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,235
So I've opened up the lid and 
immediately it should show up on screen.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,520
Ey, there we go.

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,480
We got the battery information.

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,760
We got all that stuff.

48
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,440
There are times where things get a 
little bit funny, but that's fine.

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,800
As long as you can see your own,

50
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,920
where you can see the left pod and the right 
pod are fully charged and the case is 60%.

51
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,400
Well, this number 60% is not necessarily accurate.

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,120
Because on my iPhone, it says 69%.

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,400
That's primarily because Apple 
has done a couple of tomfoolery

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,120
that restricts data that can be seen by other 
devices that are outside of Apple devices.

55
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,200
So basically anything non-Apple would end 
up seeing other stuff or just false numbers,

56
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,160
such as the battery info being one of them.

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,240
So I'm sorry, fellow Android fans.

58
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,400
There's nothing much you can do about this.

59
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,120
This affects everyone.

60
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
Now getting straight back to the 
point, let's take out one of the pods.

61
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,800
We've got the right pod out and we're going 
to play a particularly bass heavy audio.

62
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,560
As we play out this horrendously bass heavy audio,

63
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,400
you're going to be able to hear ridiculous 
sounds coming out of this thing.

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,534
And I'm going to put it near the microphone.

65
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,240
You can clearly tell this 
is not the intended effect.

66
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,600
Isn't it ridiculous?

67
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,800
Right, so today's video is going to 
be, we're going to crack it open

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,080
and find out what's wrong 
with these pairs of AirPods.

69
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,160
Oh, did I mention this problem 
shows on the other side as well?

70
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,080
So we're probably going to crack 
the other side open as well.

71
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,120
Right. With that said, we're going to 
shut off this device as usual.

72
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,840
I'm going to move it away, get it out of 
sight because we don't need it at the moment.

73
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,200
Enter your little companion, iFixit toolkit.

74
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,560
That's right. I've been the owner of the 
iFixit toolkit for a while now.

75
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,520
And when I say a while, I mean 
like many, many years actually.

76
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,480
So I figured, let's put it to good use

77
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,320
and see if we can dismantle at least one side 
of the AirPods and figure out what went wrong.

78
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,760
Because I hear pretty much exactly 
the same issue from both sides.

79
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,920
So I assume this issue is going to be,

80
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,600
if it happens on one side, it should show 
up the same on the other side as well.

81
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,400
Now I may be no expert at opening up electronics,

82
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,200
but I have done some bits of research

83
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,800
and you're going to need a spudger 
tool and a pry tool of some sort.

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,760
And when things get really difficult, 
you're going to need some tweezers.

85
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,760
I highly recommend plastic tweezers if possible,

86
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,800
but the iFixit ProTech Toolkit 
only includes these sets for me.

87
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,360
I mean, there are more, but these are 
the ones that I can work with so far.

88
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,120
So I'm going to try to pry it open.

89
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,640
So according to the guides that I see online,

90
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,080
many of which needed you to 
have a vice or a knife tool.

91
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
However, in the middle of some nights,

92
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,040
I woke up and I realized 
something hectically ridiculous.

93
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,600
If you have sheer muscles and you 
squeeze from the bottom and the top,

94
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,680
you would notice that there 
is an opening in the middle.

95
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,000
Something that the knife 
tool should have gotten into,

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,760
but for some reason, mine was cracked open.

97
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,640
So we're going to try to pry it 
by sheer force by pressing on it

98
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,943
and get the spudger tool in there.

99
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,760
Oh, oh, did you see that opening?

100
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,720
Did you see that opening?

101
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,240
Did you see it open for a brief second?

102
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,920
Did you see that?

103
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,680
What the fuck?

104
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,920
Holy fucking shit, this is nerve wracking.

105
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,680
We cracked open the AirPods.

106
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,480
Let's see what's inside of it.

107
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,360
So according to a guide, it 
says to be extremely careful

108
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,920
because there are ribbon 
cables that are nestled inside.

109
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,520
So we're going to go in with extreme caution.

110
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,720
I don't think the direction matters, I 
think, as long as you manage to pull it open.

111
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,400
Well, there we go.

112
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,960
We got it open.

113
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,240
And then you can see like there's 
a Z-line ribbon cable like that.

114
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,760
So when you pull it open, try 
not to pull it all the way

115
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,320
because you can see that 
this cable is hyper fragile.

116
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,680
Really really fragile.

117
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,520
So I'm going to start assuming things.

118
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,000
Presumably, right here is the battery 
and over this side is the driver.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,760
So that means if we want to figure 
out what's wrong with the audio,

120
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,240
we're going to need to get into the 
front of the driver, which is right here.

121
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,120
So what we need to do is,

122
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,680
presumably from the sight of it, I can see 
some glue looking paste around this thing.

123
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:50,280
So presumably we'll have to cut through 
it or pull it out in some shape or form.

124
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:57,200
With extreme caution, I'm probably going to 
resort to using one of the angle tweezers

125
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,160
to try pull out presumably any of the glue points.

126
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,920
Holy crap, it's really really hard 
to work with on a pair of gloves.

127
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,080
Let alone working barehanded, holy.

128
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,040
Oh wait, I'm looking at the wrong side.

129
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,960
Oh wait, I see some sort of opening.

130
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,960
If you can see, somewhere around the opposite 
of where the driver is coming out from,

131
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,960
like back here at the back, there is 
like a little tiny slit that seems like

132
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,440
you can kind of pry into 
without hurting the thing.

133
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,000
So I'm probably going to get this plastic 
pry tool to see if I can get into it first.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,360
I'm not, I can't really guarantee success,

135
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,360
but I think we could be able to get 
something, some infos out of it.

136
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,480
Okay, this thing is a bit too thick.

137
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,840
We probably need to get a 
thinner tool like these tweezers.

138
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,920
Now working with electronics 
like these are really fragile

139
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,920
and they tend to break off really 
easily, so please please please,

140
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,920
if you don't know what you're doing, 
please do not, do not attempt this.

141
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,560
Take it to a professional 
and have them do it instead.

142
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,160
Even if they charge you like crazy, it's 
often worth it if it's really complex.

143
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,320
Oh, I think I got it in.

144
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,240
I think I pried it.

145
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, wedge it.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,520
Not too hard, just enough to stick it up.

147
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,080
Oh, it's going up, it's going up, it's going up.

148
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's going up.

149
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,240
Look at this.

150
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,160
Oh, there we go.

151
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,000
It's coming up.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,960
You seen this?

153
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,080
Right. So, there should be, according to the guide,

154
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,200
another ribbon cable that's 
for the skin detection sensor.

155
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,520
Oh, I found it, I found it.

156
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,360
It's along on the same side where it went in.

157
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,813
Where that ribbon cable went in, it's 
on the same side coming out that way.

158
00:08:41,926 --> 00:08:46,488
Errgghhhhhh, eggghhhhhh, look at that!

159
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:49,640
Errrrhhhhhh, what the fuck is this?

160
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,680
What the fuck is this dystopian shit?

161
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,040
Look at this blue stuff right here, what the fuck?

162
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,160
I think a dye just fucking, I think a 
die (diode) just fucking melted or something.

163
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,320
Jesus fucking- Errghhhh, eeeerghhhh, eurghhhhhh.

164
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,200
Okay, okay, okay, right.

165
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:13,640
Let's continue our diagnosis.

166
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,960
There is a piece of foam 
thingy looking inside here.

167
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,840
That's what audio people call it, the filter,

168
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,600
which is kind of like, it blocks 
objects from entering the thing,

169
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,480
but still allows sound through.

170
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,040
You can kind of see it's really, really thin here.

171
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,320
Let's get the Airpods case to compare.

172
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,720
It's really, really thin, and as you can see,

173
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,840
it's kind of chock full of solid 
looking thingies, thingamajigs.

174
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,720
Presumably, it might be my 
earwax, I gotta be honest.

175
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,040
I mean, I've used it for four years now, but 
I honestly think it could last way longer.

176
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,760
At least we know that the filter is 
doing its job, so great props to that.

177
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,880
We're gonna put this aside, and we're gonna 
investigate right into the root cause.

178
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,200
Presumably, the audio driver.

179
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,760
And from what I can see, 
this is clearly not natural.

180
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,800
So what happened is, um, usually,

181
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,840
usually speaker drivers are 
completely covered from all around.

182
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,240
But as you can see, the main 
driver in the middle looks intact.

183
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,640
But if you look outside, you see that 
there's supposed to be a ring around it?

184
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,560
Yeah, on this curve right here, it 
does not exist anymore, it seems.

185
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,640
So what happened is that, presumably, the 
crackling noises we've been hearing so far

186
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,080
has been that the main frequency 
has been flapping along,

187
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,600
but because of that, the vibration 
is passing through these openings,

188
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,920
which causes no audio,

189
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,400
but at the same time, it causes these things to 
flap so much that it makes funny crackling noises.

190
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,600
Let's try playing that same audio from 
earlier, and see if that's the case.

191
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,360
Let's have a look at the driver 
itself, when that happens.

192
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,400
Oh yeah, oh yeah, did you see that?

193
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
Did you see that?

194
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,680
The coils came out too.

195
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,840
Everything's coming out.

196
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,360
It's completely out of whack.

197
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,480
If I try to press it down, press it 
down to where it's supposed to be,

198
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,080
it's flapping in its space.

199
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:21,640
And you can hear that this is exactly 
what's making the crackling noises.

200
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:29,400
So that means, in conclusion, what happened 
is that the diaphragm of the speaker driver

201
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,960
has completely cracked open that 
renders it completely useless.

202
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,760
Though not to worry, I'm going 
to, if I do have the money,

203
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,160
I'm planning to pick up some replacement 
audio drivers from AliExpress.

204
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,160
It may not be as reliable, but I 
think it would be the best for me,

205
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,080
especially after I've been 
using it for a long time.

206
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,560
Not to mention, if you actually look at the 
service fee for the Apple service centers,

207
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,960
they usually cost, if you have to repair both 
sides, almost the cost of a brand new unit.

208
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,920
Isn't that fucking insane that I just 
bought this device for so much money

209
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,520
and to replace a speaker driver that 
it's going to cost me a brand new unit?

210
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,720
I could have just bought a fucking 
new pair of AirPods instead then.

211
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,640
So that point of time, with my money really, 
really tight, when I say really, really tight,

212
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,720
I mean like genuinely broke 
tight, I went out of my way

213
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,320
and do some research in the audiophile space.

214
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,240
And with my extremely tight 
money and a sub $25 goal,

215
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,080
I've picked up a pair of Moondrop Space Travel.

216
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,480
Honestly, the Moondrop Space Travel 
is a really nifty pair of earphones,

217
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,360
albeit the mic being really bad, 
but they sound really, really good.

218
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,680
They're also my entry point for in-ears because 
they have this body that clings into my ears,

219
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,520
similar to how the original AirPods do.

220
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,160
And then you got a bit of silicone in-ears,  

221
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,120
which could train my ear canals 
to get used to the in-ears.

222
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,920
So this may be a great entry 
point for in-ears for me.

223
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,280
Not to mention, I've done a lot of 
research and people have said that

224
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,040
the Moondrop Space Travel is the 
budget king of its price range.

225
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,000
So after a whole month of using,

226
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,760
I honestly am really, really impressed by its 
audio quality for that kind of price range.

227
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:19,960
I've saved myself eight fucking times the price 
of the AirPods unit itself, and I got this.

228
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,640
Isn't that fucking insane?

229
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,840
Yeah, I honestly do think so as well.

230
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,760
I'll probably open up the left 
side pair of the AirPods off camera

231
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,280
and I'll tell you the results on screen right 
here if I actually do have open it up and see.

232
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,680
But yeah, honestly, I'm really fucking 
disgusted by what Apple has done so far.

233
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,609
Apple, you really need to 
make your AirPods genuinely repairable 

234
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:42,360
for your own service center people.

235
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,160
I don't care if you don't make 
it repairable for third parties.

236
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,640
Make it repairable for your 
own people as well, idiots.

237
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,480
Right, with that said, thank you so 
much for watching this little vlog

238
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,040
of me yapping away about my pair of 
AirPods that I have and regret buying.

239
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
And be sure to subscribe for more tech videos

240
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,040
and probably a series of gaming 
videos if you're interested in those.

241
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,520

see from me in the comments below,

242
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,400
and I'll catch you guys next time.

243
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,640
I'm so sorry for that really, really 
short video, but I'm really, really eepy.

244
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,920
But I still really want to get through this video

245
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,360
because I really want to get 
people to know what's been going on

246
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,520
with my set of electronics 
and let my voices heard.

247
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,439
So thank you guys so much for watching.

248
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:25,920
OtsuMelo deshita (It's been ya girl Mel).
Catch you next time.

249
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,440
Oh, also don't forget to 
check out my buddy at CAPod

250
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,960
as well on top of SD Maid SE, which 
is what he initially sponsored me for.

251
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,200
CAPod is a really, really neat piece of app,

252
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,440
and I highly recommend you check it 
out if you use AirPods on Android.

253
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,320
With that said, catch you guys next time.

254
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:59,040
See ya, OtsuMelo!
