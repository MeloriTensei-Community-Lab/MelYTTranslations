1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,080
Computers.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,480
We all use computers all around us.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,000
Sometimes it will be for work,

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,560
sometimes it will be for gaming,

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,120
sometimes it will be something else.

6
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,480
Probably for content 
consumption, content creation,

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,280
a whole slew of other stuff 
that you can do with a computer.

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,840
After all, the silicone is very versatile

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,800
and we sometimes take it for granted.

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,400
And as someone who's quite an enthusiast at tech,

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,880
you may sometimes ask yourself 
this age-old question,

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,600
how much of computers do we need to know

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,080
to build the absolute banger of a PC that I want?

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,440
Now fret no more,

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,320
because I got it all prepared again.

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,040
So I got onto PCPartPicker because 
I can't really do IRL shopping

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,240
because I'm stupidly broke.

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,200
Sad.

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,800
So instead, I'm going to be shopping online.

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,360
With a little help of Amazon

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,320
and a little bit help of 
whatever PCPartPicker has.

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,160
We're gonna try to build up a rig

23
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,120
for four specific different types of people.

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,960
And here I got myself a list of profiles

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,560
of four different types of people

26
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,640
that we're gonna look into and try to build up

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,520
a spec sheet for those kinds of people

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,800
and explain what goes into my 
mind as I select certain parts.

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,080
Now as you can see with the first profile,

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,800
this is going to be a regular thing

31
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,360
because currencies are confusing to me

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,000
and I'm practically everywhere.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,720
So instead, I'm just going 
to simulate picking parts

34
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,760
based on how powerful each of them are.

35
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,120
So based on each of these 
profiles without a budget,

36
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,200
we're gonna try to build a 
specifically suitable computer for them

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,560
without absolutely blowing the living budget.

38
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,920
We're gonna be a little bit realistic with this.

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,520
So let's start with the first person.

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,320
The first person happens 
to be a university student,

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,320
primarily low to medium 
requirement kinds of games.

42
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,600
Example, League, oh god,

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,960
Valorant, and Apex Legends.

44
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,760
Watching university lectures through 
YouTube and online school portals,

45
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,400
having online classes through Zoom or Google Meet.

46
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,120
So basically, a standard all-rounder 
is what I'm thinking about right now.

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,680
But considering how we got a little bit 
of Valorant and a little bit of Apex,

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm thinking we may need to,

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,200
from the average scale, bump 
up the graphics a little bit.

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,640
But I think we will do fine 
with a pretty chill processor.

51
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,320
Let's get straight into creating a sheet.

52
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,280
Right, now that we're on PCPartPicker,

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,120
we're gonna get into starting the build.

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
Alright, with that said, we're gonna start out

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
with two of the most important criteria.

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,440
The person wanted to game,

57
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,600
but they also wanted to be 
able to attend online classes.

58
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,280
So we're gonna need 2 out of 3 GPU

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,840
and a 1 out of 3 CPU kind of split.

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,160
It may sound a bit funny

61
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,920
and may sound a little bit weird 
for all of you tech enthusiasts,

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,360
but hear me out, hear me out.

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
Usually, I would visualize 
this in a graph in my mind,

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,000
but it's a little hard to get it out of my mouth.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
So we're gonna start a little simple.

66
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,680
So a pretty simple CPU, I 
would say sometime around...

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,720
but if the said person's 
not really too big of a rush

68
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,880
when it comes to getting 
the absolute latest of tech,

69
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,320
I would say the 12600K or 12600 would be fine.

70
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,440
The reason why I'm not going 
any lower like 12400 is because

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,320
Windows 11 as a requirement is starting

72
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,880
to become a lot more demanding these days.

73
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,320
And with Intel's new core architecture, 
where it has P-Cores and E-Cores,

74
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,880
I honestly think Windows would be 
kind of strained on the E-Core side

75
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,360
for simple tasks like navigating the start menu

76
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,360
and going through the even so smaller stuff,

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,720
which could hold back the operating 
system a little bit in my opinion.

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,200
Although AMD Ryzen would be the 
budget choice for some builds,

79
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,440
in my opinion, the old 
architecture arrangement may be

80
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,120
a little bit spread out I guess,

81
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,720
considering how all the cores 
are treated exactly the same

82
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,600
and Windows may just occupy all the cores,

83
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,240
which then leaves them all busy

84
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,080
and it could just make core 
performance a little bit less optimized

85
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,360
in my visualization to say the least.

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,440
I'm not really too sure if 
it reflects the real world

87
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,120
because I've never really had the new 
Intel's P-Core, E-Core architecture yet.

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,720
So if we are to pick up the 
12th gen, say the 12600,

89
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,120
let's see how much that costs.

90
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,360
Oh, that's a…

91
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,040
okay.

92
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,680
Don't you think it's a little weird that the 12600

93
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,440
is currently costing double 
the price of the 12600KF?

94
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,120
Huh, the Amazon market's a little funny this time.

95
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,680
Okay, we're gonna pick up the 12600k first.

96
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,600
We'r not gonna worry too much 
because we're just getting started,

97
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,680
so we can change just about anything.

98
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,080
This is not THE FIRST TAKE.

99
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,240
We got plenty of lives, so 
we can change them whenever.

100
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,560
So we're gonna start simple.

101
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,200
Right, for coolers, I would highly 
recommend something decently quiet

102
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,680
and usually you would go with Noctua's.

103
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,640
However, other brands would be fine 
if you're really tight on budget,

104
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,320
but personally in my opinion, I 
really really like the Noctua NH-U12S.

105
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,320
If possible, for aesthetic reasons, 
you can also pick up the Chromax Black.

106
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,720
We're gonna hold on to that.

107
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,400
This might change at some 
point, so does the processor.

108
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,080
Right, following that, for memory,

109
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,960
personally I would highly recommend 
that you would pick up 16 gigs and above

110
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,280
because Windows 11 is stupidly demanding.

111
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,520
I'm pretty much a heavy user myself,

112
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,960
and what I mean by heavy user,

113
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,120
I mean like there is at least 4x4 amount 
of background processes on my taskbar,

114
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,200
and I would have at least one or 
two primary heavy applications,

115
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,040
something like YouTube in 4k and 
Discord with too many chats open.

116
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,960
Though in comparison with gaming, I 
don't think it's really that heavy,

117
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,720
but it would be kind of CPU heavy to be honest.

118
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,800
But even with that, look at this monstrosity!

119
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,000
With all my background processes running,

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
oh shit it's not 4x4, I got more than that.

121
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,960
With all these processes running in 
background, and I need all of them,

122
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,240
look at how much RAM it's taking right now!

123
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,480
At least this includes all the 
applications that I'm using,

124
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,800
but Windows itself would 
take at least eight of it.

125
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,840
At least that's what I've observed with 
my own laptop that only has 8 gigs of RAM.

126
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,520
You can hardly run on that 
thing with 8 gigs of RAM,

127
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,160
so I highly recommend you to 
pick up at least 16 or more.

128
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,320
Though 32 may be a bit overkill 
for this gentleman right here

129
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,760
who only games and attends classes,

130
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,160
so 16 gigs is the way to go.

131
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,720
And luckily with PCPartPicker, we 
could just pick something like this.

132
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,080
So depending on your setup, 
if you like faster RAM...

133
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,520
Oh my god, what am I saying.

134
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,720
If you're planning to have multiple sticks of RAM

135
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,040
and have multiple channels to 
be utilized at the same time,

136
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,680
which usually means um.. "faster 
bandwidth" as many would say,

137
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,440
but in my opinion I don't really think 
that matters for that small size of RAM.

138
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,840
So I'd rather say,

139
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,160
if the university student suddenly 
wants to start gaming harder,

140
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,560
I would leave them some room for upgrades.

141
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,080
So I would pick a single stick of 16(GB).

142
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,920
However, if you have absolutely 
no plans to upgrade at all,

143
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,600
then you would definitely be better off with 2x8s

144
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,920
because two channels is always better than one

145
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,120
when it comes to latency, at least, 
even if bandwidth does not matter.

146
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,880
Now in terms of RAM types, between DDR4 and DDR5,

147
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,320
this would vary significantly with the 
motherboard that you're going to pick.

148
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,760
And this may be a bit of a misstep from me

149
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,440
because we should have picked the 
motherboard first before we pick the RAM,

150
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,480
but the reason why I went for the RAM first is

151
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,840
because I wanted the builder 
to be very price conscious.

152
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,440
Because in event the person picks a 
motherboard that uses DDR5 memory,

153
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,560
you're going to be locked behind 
a really really high paywall

154
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,120
for the premiumness of DDR5 that 
is still going on right now.

155
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
However, you won't have a choice 
for particularly Ryzen boards.

156
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,600
Starting Ryzen 7th Gen, you're 
going to be on DDR5 only

157
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,080
and there is no DDR4 supported 
boards in Ryzen 7th Gen sadly.

158
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,520
However, for Intel, they still leave 
you that kind of option for some gens.

159
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,680
I'm sure Intel at some point at a certain gen,

160
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,360
they're going to start changing 
their minds and lock it out.

161
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,840
So while we still can, we're going to make 
good use of the value portion of this.

162
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
So we're going to pick DDR4 for now.

163
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,160
Now that we've picked the speed and the type,

164
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,120
we're going to look into the 
sets of RAM that are available.

165
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,840
Now a whole lot of tech tubers 
like LinusTechTips and JayzTwoCents

166
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,200
would likely be recommending Crucials or Microns.

167
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,280
Or if you're into significantly shorter latency,

168
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,880
you would also pick up Corsair or G-Skill.

169
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,960
For someone who's only playing 
League, Valorant, and Apex,

170
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,240
I don't really think RAM latency would actually

171
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,000
make a difference for this particular person.

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,880
However, it would make a tiny 
difference for timing intensive games.

173
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,440
So usually I would just go 
straight for the value option.

174
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,560
Which looking through the price list...

175
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,480
or we could just sort it like that,

176
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,400
most of which on the value 
proposition is from Patriot.

177
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,720
Though I have not really heard of Patriot, 
so I can't really say much for them.

178
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,800
So instead, I'm gonna go with one that 
I've trusted for a while from Crucial.

179
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,760
Oh right, forgot to mention, the 
RAM speed does matter at some games.

180
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,560
Say for example GTA.

181
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,720
Though I'm not really a GTA player myself,

182
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,920
but I've seen some people with benchmarks

183
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,920
that have shown some differences 
with the stock speed of 2133

184
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,720
against the speed of 3200 or 3600.

185
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,120
Usually for League, Valorant, 
and Apex, 2666 is perfectly fine,

186
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,160
but 3200 would be better than nothing.

187
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,920
And let's do some quick research with the 12600K.

188
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,160
Now believe me, this build 
guide is not really going to be

189
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,760
for beginner friendly, but it would be 
nice for you to collect some information.

190
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,240
So building up a spec sheet 
involves a lot of cross-referencing

191
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,600
and a lot of cross-checking.

192
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,960
Haha, lithography?

193
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,360
Intel 7?

194
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,800
You are a fucking joke, Intel.

195
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,960
For context, Intel 7 is not really 
7 nanometer, it's actually 10nm.

196
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,000
Intel is just screwing business people up.

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,960
Alright, back to our search.

198
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,480
We're gonna look through in 
Intel's official specifications.

199
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,880
On memory types, they recommend 
that they officially support up to

200
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,920
3200 megatransfers per second on DDR4.

201
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,840
Anything higher than that would 
technically be overclocking

202
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,040
on the processor's own controller end.

203
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,560
So that means if we want to stay on the safe side,

204
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,120
we would be better off picking up the 3200.

205
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,080
So in this case, we would happily take that

206
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,440
because that would be pretty much the fastest 
officially supported to say the least.

207
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,080
Though RAM overclocking isn't 
really all that dangerous,

208
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,360
it's just that there may be some degree 
of instability that you might not expect.

209
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,120
The chances are hyper slim, 
but they're never zero.

210
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,000
Considering how we're talking 
about a university student,

211
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,920
we wouldn't want crashes to happen so 
often when they're doing their assignments.

212
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,560
So it's always best to stay on the 
safe side for this guy for now.

213
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,200
And on to the motherboard.

214
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
We could have done the 
motherboard from the get-go,

215
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,520
but I wanted people to be RAM conscious for now.

216
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,000
And since we've picked a DDR4 RAM,

217
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,720
you can see that PCPartPicker has 
also grayed out the DDR5 options,

218
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,400
leaving us only the options to pick up DDR4 RAMs.

219
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,040
That's fine.

220
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,320
Now looking through the popularity rating,

221
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,400
you can see that the most popular boards 
are usually one of the higher-end ones,

222
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
so we're not gonna really look into that.

223
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,240
How about we take this a little bit wilder?

224
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,760
Considering that we're picking up the 12600K,

225
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,920
we're also giving an option for overclocking.

226
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,880
Even though we're not intending to overclock,

227
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,120
sometimes it's also good to leave 
him some room for overclocking

228
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,400
if he wishes to experiment with it.

229
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,080
Say they graduated or something.

230
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,960
So for that, we're going to 
outright miss out on the B series,

231
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,640
because on Intel's side, the B series 
motherboards are usually non-overclockable.

232
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,080
And the H series is below the B series,

233
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,720
which means it's a little bit 
lower-end to say the least.

234
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,600
So what we want is to start from the Z series.

235
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,760
So we got an option between the Z690 and a Z790,

236
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,720
though I don't really have personal 
experience with the Intel side

237
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,240
of this of these series of chipsets, 
but I'm going to try my absolute best

238
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,960
to pick out what's really best for the person.

239
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:44,160
Overclocking may sometimes stress out a module 
called VRM, or voltage regulator module,

240
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,360
which usually only happens if you're going 
to overclock in a really extreme manner.

241
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,040
Otherwise, most of the times, it 
should be fine without a heatsink.

242
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,880
However, it's always best with a heatsink.

243
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,720
We're gonna have a good look at the 
motherboard and see what they got.

244
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,640
In hindsight, we could kind of see that 
there are heatsinks accompanying the VRMs,

245
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,280
even if they're not directly connected.

246
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,760
What am I saying even?

247
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,440
God damn it.

248
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,800
So looking at the motherboard,

249
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,320
we can see that there's currently two PCIe slots,

250
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,480
which are usually used by 
GPUs and other add-in cards.

251
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,880
Four RAM slots, looks pretty nifty.

252
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,400
I assume it would be two channels, 
because this two would be one channel,

253
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,600
and then this two would be one channel.

254
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,640
And we got heatsinks accompanying the VRM,

255
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,480
which looks good in my opinion.

256
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,720
And it looks pretty barebones and very simple.

257
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,200
Now let's have a look at the I.O.

258
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,520
Looking at the I.O., it does look very barebones.

259
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,600
We got ourselves mic in, line out, and line in.

260
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,320
It is very very simple.

261
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,160
We got one, two, three, four, five, six USB 3.0s,

262
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,160
and a single HDMI for integrated 
graphics, if you're going to use that,

263
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,920
and a single LAN port, which is probably gigabit.

264
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,520
Let me just have a good look here.

265
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,800
Onboard Ethernet, one gigabit.

266
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,720
Okay, yeah, it is.

267
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,320
So it is a gigabit LAN port.

268
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,080
However, with my personal testimonies 
with a whole lot of different builders,

269
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,840
at least a small minority of 
them have personally told me

270
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,040
that they have poor experience 
with ASRock firmware.

271
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,800
However, with many other creators they have saw,

272
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,600
they haven't really talked about issues 
with it, so your mileage may vary.

273
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
However, ASRock is already a pretty named brand,

274
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,480
so if there's an issue, you can totally RMA it.

275
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,720
So that's not too big of a problem.

276
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,560
And considering how in terms of the price range,

277
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,600
they start to vary sharply from here on,

278
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,680
and we're only needing pretty much 
the basic abilities for the person,

279
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,920
I say it would be nice to 
give him this motherboard.

280
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,880
He can continue to upgrade them if he so needs to.

281
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,600
Right, from here we're gonna have some fun,

282
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,120
because the harder part is mostly out by now.

283
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,760
So we're gonna start with storage.

284
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,120
So League doesn't really take that much storage.

285
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,480
Valorant takes quite a number.

286
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,360
Apex takes a bangton.

287
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,440
I honestly think going full SSD 
is kind of worth it these days,

288
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,720
especially with the current market at least.

289
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,600
If we're talking about the 
lower end SSDs at least,

290
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,280
because we want to make sure that this is 
university-student-friendly as possible.

291
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,840
We don't want this build to be overkill in price.

292
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,760
So like I said, this build sheet will 
change at some point of this video,

293
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,960
so don't click away, because you and me,

294
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,560
we're going to look into this process

295
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,920
and go through the mentality of how I pick parts.

296
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,240
Usually I would start somewhere and 
then I'll change things as we go.

297
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,720
So usually I'm a big fan of budget 
SSDs, and what I meant by budget SSDs,

298
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,800
I mean like those lower end slower 
SSDs that are still quite fast,

299
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,320
faster than HDD, but they don't break your bank.

300
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,240
And this is where price per gigabyte 
starts to become important for you,

301
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,280
at least you, because this is kind of 
metric that we're going to be using

302
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,520
when we're going through some of these SSDs.

303
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,160
But first, size.

304
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,600
What we want is to start making up 
our mind about how much gigabytes

305
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,320
we want to give this said person.

306
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,400
Considering Windows already taking 
up at least 30 gigs of the system,

307
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,960
but let's say this university 
student has a lot of research papers

308
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,800
that they need to store, so we're 
going to bring that up a little bit.

309
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,160
And now what we want to do, just 
for safety measure, double it up.

310
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,640
We're going to give him 256 gigs of boot drive

311
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,160
and look through the lowest price range for that.

312
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,240
Whoopsie, we forgot to set the minimum.

313
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,920
Actually we gotta set the minimum to 240,

314
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
because some drives can get a little bit funny.

315
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,040
I'm talking to you Kingston.

316
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,080
Looking through the lowest list of SSDs,

317
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,800
there are a whole lot of 
what's called the SATA SSDs,

318
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,960
which are 2.5-inch drives 
that are through an interface

319
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,120
that is admittedly criminally slow 
in the current times for an SSD.

320
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,960
So to avoid that, we're 
gonna go back into the filter

321
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,560
and go through the interface 
list and pick up all that is M.2.

322
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,480
You can clearly see that 
I've also picked M.2 SATA.

323
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,680
That's primarily because some M.2 slots can switch

324
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,080
modes between SATA mode and PCIe mode.

325
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,160
So if we do pick up a budget SSD now,

326
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,200
the said university student 
can do an upgrade in the future

327
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,080
to something a lot more faster.

328
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,520
However, in my personal opinion,

329
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,240
M.2 SATA is still a little bit criminally 
slow, just like I said earlier.

330
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,880
So we're gonna take that out.

331
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,720
However, if you're into the 
bare bones from the beginning,

332
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
you can feel free to have SATA on.

333
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,560
We're gonna be dead focused on M.2 SSDs for now.

334
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,320
So looking through the price list once more,

335
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,840
we got ourselves quite a selection.

336
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,520
However, I would personally avoid WD Green,

337
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,720
because the WD Green is very much 
of a very passive kind of drive

338
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,320
that you would use to just store 
stuff and never use them as often.

339
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,520
It's more of a power budget friendly 
version of those kinds of SSDs.

340
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,320
The regular version of this particular 
would be the WD Blue instead.

341
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,200
And going further down, we're gonna look into...

342
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,440
Oh hey, we got ADATA XPG SX6000 Pro.

343
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,800
However, I'm not going to recommend that drive,

344
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,960
especially whatever happened recently.

345
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
ADATA XPG, I'm looking at you.

346
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,560
Whatever you've done back then,

347
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,240
the silicon swap, that's not cool.

348
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,480
You have pissed me off as a former customer.

349
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,000
I built a PC with that SSD on,

350
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,600
and I was actually very surprised 
because I was lucky as hell at the time.

351
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,400
I picked up one that had the Samsung chip in it.

352
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,240
For those who are wondering, 
the XPG SX8200, okay...

353
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,120
the 8200 Pro is amazing when 
you have the Samsung chip on it

354
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,160
instead of the other inferior chip.

355
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,120
We did a whole lot of series of testing, 
and the boot times were impressive.

356
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,000
The download speeds are impressive.

357
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,760
At least it maxes out my 
internet, THAT kind of impressive.

358
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,680
Doing anything with transfers on 
that drive was super impressive.

359
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,760
However, after the chip swap, I don't 
know if I can trust you anymore, ADATA.

360
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,880
Like, I was going to trust you 
until you did this shit to me.

361
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,400
You betrayed me, bro.

362
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,600
So instead, we're gonna go further down.

363
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,800
Ah yes, the Kingston NV2, the 
ye'olde trusted budget-friendly SSD.

364
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,720
Now, personally, I'm using the Kingston A1000,

365
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,360
which is kind of like the slightly 
inferior older version of this.

366
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,200
And it is safe to say, in my 
opinion, that it is adequately fast.

367
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,840
Though the boot times are not as impressive,

368
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,040
maybe about like 7 seconds or 10 seconds.

369
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,880
But it is still just as fast as 
what a basic PCIe NVMe SSD would do.

370
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,320
So considering we're gonna hunt for 
the budget for this university student,

371
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,680
I would happily pick that up for this person.

372
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,240
Absolutely in a heartbeat.

373
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,360
However, if you do want faster, there's 
always better choices out there.

374
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,600
Say, for example, the Corsairs and the Samsungs.

375
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,680
But we're not gonna look into that, 
but we'll get into that in a moment.

376
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,080
However, we could add additional 
storage if budget allows us.

377
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,040
We're gonna allow ourselves 
a leeway of budget this time.

378
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,120
And instead, we're gonna 
switch to the 3.5-inch drives,

379
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,960
which are usually the HDDs.

380
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,160
And we're gonna use SATA interface 
because there's no such thing as M.2 HDDs.

381
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,120
And we're gonna hunt for the budget options.

382
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,960
Now, if you're into the second-hand market,

383
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,240
you will be very familiar with 
the Western Digital Caviar Blue.

384
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,280
The Caviar Blue is, if anything,

385
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:58,000
the tried-and-true budget king for HDDs 
in that kind of budget price range.

386
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,040
However, there are more and 
more affordable HDDs out there

387
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,160
that are slightly better in quality 
and does not do tomfooleries

388
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,640
like what Western Digital did with the RED drives.

389
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,760
I'll attach those articles on screen 
so you know what I meant by that.

390
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,600
So my trust with WD is a little bit 
fractured because of what they've done there.

391
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,520
However, this goes without saying, I 
still want to give them some chances.

392
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,760
We're going to do what we usually do.

393
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,440
So the capacity I want to give them would be,

394
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,080
I'll say 1TB would be the basic goal too.

395
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,080
We're gonna have our capacity 
target starting from 1TB.

396
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,120
And as you can see, we have 
a whole slew of choice,

397
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,720
but I personally would not pick up non-popular 
drives that are up there because personally,

398
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,520
if you haven't had other people 
with experience of those drives,

399
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,280
it will be really hard for you 
to tell if this is good or not.

400
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,680
So I've never really heard of AV-GP.

401
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,200
I've never, I don't think I've done any 
personal research of the Constellation ES3,

402
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,680
so I can't really speak for those drives at all.

403
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,720
However, what I can speak for 
is the basic Seagate Barracuda,

404
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,160
WD Carvia Blue, and the Standard Blues.

405
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,640
They're technically the same thing anyways.

406
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,520
I mean almost.

407
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,920
They do differ by speeds.

408
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,200
These are usually the gambits of budget HDDs.

409
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,040
And if you're just looking to 
store some university stuff

410
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,360
that you won't touch as much as often,

411
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,480
or you just want to store some basic memories,

412
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,400
I would probably recommend 
picking up the Seagate Barracuda.

413
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,680
But if you're starting to keep important 
memories like say family photos and stuff,

414
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,000
I highly recommend using cloud storage instead

415
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,640
or get a longer lasting HDD, which 
are not those drives I just mentioned.

416
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,400
Okay, so we've picked out 
storage for the safe person.

417
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,880
Let's get into the video card, the GPU.

418
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,560
Ooh, spooky scary.

419
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,320
It's one of the toughest things to pick.

420
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,280
If you don't have a baseline, 
say a previous GPU you've used

421
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,560
on the desktop scene, not the laptop scene,

422
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,880
it would be really really hard for you

423
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,280
to gauge which GPU you would like to pick up.

424
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,520
So for me personally, I have 
used the GT 730, the GTX 1080,

425
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,160
the RTX 3060, and the AMD RX 5700 XT.

426
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,560
My range of GPU selection might 
be a little bit extra slim,

427
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,240
so knowing that this person's going to 
be playing League, Valorant and Apex,

428
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,280
usually I can tell that this person's 
going to use a 1080p monitor.

429
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,640
It's unlikely for a university student 
to be using a 1440p or 4k monitor,

430
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,280
unless say they're an art student.

431
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,400
But considering how the profile 
just says university student,

432
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,160
we're not really too sure if 
they're really an art student,

433
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,040
considering there's no mention about 
using a drawing pen or any of the sort.

434
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,720
So it's likely just 1080p.

435
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,320
And also considering the market 
as of the time of recording,

436
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,160
which is the 13th of May,

437
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,560
at the moment 1080p is still usually 
the budget moment for monitors.

438
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,400
So if we put this into consideration,

439
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,280
League can run pretty much on a fucking toaster,

440
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,920
so we don't really need to think about that.

441
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,080
Valorant can run just fine 
on a mid-range graphics card,

442
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,280
and Apex would be a little bit 
more CPU sided than GPU honestly.

443
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,040
We will get into that point later.

444
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,320
But with that said, in my personal 
experience with the RTX 3060,

445
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,120
Apex can run absolutely fine on 1080p.

446
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,160
So with that considered, we could 
kind of cut it down a lot further

447
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,880
if we're looking into considerations of budget.

448
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,600
So we're gonna try to add 
these two for the moment.

449
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,240
Oh, how about the AMD side?

450
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,640
We're gonna not leave them alone.

451
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,320
We're gonna bring them in, 
bring them up to the spotlight.

452
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:26,640
So we're gonna bring in the 6500, 6600, 
6600XT, 6700XT, and the 7 series as well.

453
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,920
7600, 7700... that should be fine.

454
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,240
This will be our current selection 
of GPUs that we're gonna look into.

455
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,680
And looking at the budget options,

456
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,040
it's taking us to ASRock, Sapphire Pulse,

457
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,520
a whole lot of them that are Radeon RX 6500XT,

458
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,920
but there's also Gigabyte 
Eagle OC that is a 3050 6 gig.

459
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,360
So this is what we're gonna think a lot about.

460
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,720
If this person's not playing any AAA 
games above Apex or any of the sort,

461
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,080
the 3050 would kind of be 
barely fine on medium settings.

462
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,200
But if this person's planning 
to play anything more than that,

463
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,160
then I would highly recommend picking up the 3060

464
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,880
or the equivalent on AMD, which is the 6700.

465
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,040
Oh, we could also look at the 4060s, add 
those into the list, because budget reasons.

466
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,000
If we're looking into the 60s already,

467
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,280
then you would want to compare 
against the 30s and the 40s

468
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,680
in terms of market prices,

469
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,360
because currently the 30 series 
is coming down in prices,

470
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,400
but it's not coming down slim enough to 
have an excuse to be the budget king yet,

471
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,920
at least in my current market in my area.

472
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,960
However, in some areas,

473
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,680
like say in the western market, the 3060s 
would be amazing for budget reasons,

474
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,240
and there would be less and less 
reasons for 3050s to be around.

475
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,360
So considering how they specifically 
say low to medium requirement games,

476
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,920
I'd say the 3050 would do 
absolutely fine for them, really.

477
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,960
There might be some things 
that I may fail to mention,

478
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,440
so please point it out to me in the 
comments below, because sharing is caring.

479
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,520
But for now, we're gonna give them the 3050.

480
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,840
Though we could pick up the Radeon RX 6500 XT,

481
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,640
but in my personal opinion, the 
AMD drivers are just about there,

482
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,360
but it's not really there there, you know?

483
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,840
And on the talks about ray tracing, 
it may be a little bit ehhhhhhhhhh…

484
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,040
Say what if the person needs 
to pick up a ray tracing game?

485
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,240
Then, mmmm, you know, it's not 
we're not really there yet.

486
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,200
Sorry Lisa, we're not 
picking you up at the moment.

487
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,520
The Gigabyte Eagle OC is a 
pretty sound option for me.

488
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,360
Usually in some areas, brand don't 
really matter when it comes to GPU,

489
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,960
and the cooling performance is usually 
always better than the Founders Edition.

490
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,480
So we're gonna pick those up for now.

491
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,920
And as for the case, considering how 
we've picked up an M-ATX motherboard,

492
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,720
a micro ATX motherboard,

493
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,320
which means they are a little bit 
smaller than the standard ATX size,

494
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,600
we would have the choice to pick up cases 
that are smaller than the full towers.

495
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,840
So for that, we can select all the ATXs 
as like a choice for the larger size,

496
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,800
and we're gonna pick up all the M-ATXs as well.

497
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,480
And let's look through the cheapest case.

498
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,600
Let's see what shitshow it's going to give me.

499
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,640
DIYPC F2.

500
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,480
Who is DIYPC?

501
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,080
What the heck?

502
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,200
Who are you?

503
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,360
I've never heard of you.

504
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,200
What the fuck?

505
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,120
Why do you look like a stolen cooler master?

506
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,040
What the heck?

507
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,960
Okay, I'm not looking at those for now.

508
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,040
Jesus.

509
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,080
So if the university student is 
currently living in a said dorm,

510
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,920
then size would actually start to matter,

511
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,800
and we're gonna have to start worrying about that.

512
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,200
So let's look into the Cooler Master MasterBox.

513
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,480
Let's see how it's like.

514
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,880
Hmm, interesting.

515
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,240
Now considering if we're picking 
up a smaller case than standard,

516
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,960
you're going to need to start worrying 
about what's called the clearance.

517
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,920
So if you remembered earlier that 
we've picked the Noctua NH-U12S,

518
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,280
we're gonna need to double check if 
this case is small enough to fit in.

519
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,840
If this cooler is small enough to fit in the case.

520
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,280
Because the smaller the case size, the more 
we have to worry about all these stuffs.

521
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,560
Hence why there's a lot of cross 
referencing in computer parts picking.

522
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,400
So usually you could just 
go up to Noctua's website

523
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,360
and head to [Support] and look through 
[Noctua's Compatibility Center].

524
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
And in Noctua's compatibility standard,

525
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,240
you can click on [Cases] and 
search for [Manufacturer].

526
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,680
So which in this case, we're currently 
eyeing on the Cooler Master MasterBox.

527
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,760
So, Cooler Master...

528
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,680
Let's look at the model number... Q300L.

529
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,720
Right, getting back here.

530
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,040
I'm going to search for Q300L.

531
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,760
Let's look at the compatibility

532
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,240
and see if it's compatible with 
our coolers that we just picked.

533
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,280
So the cooler that we were 
picking was the NH-U12S.

534
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,960
And you can see that there's a green check,

535
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,400
which means it's fully compatible.

536
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,440
That means it fits.

537
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,080
So, good!

538
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,880
We've basically found a case that suits it.

539
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,400
Wait up, before you continue,

540
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,160
there's one more thing that we have to 
worry about when it comes to clearance,

541
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,240
the GPU.

542
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,440
Because if you zoom in right now, oh Jesus.

543
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,960
Because if you zoom in right now,

544
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,720
look at how it barely fits a Strix 
graphics card in the product image.

545
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,560
Okay, let's be real.

546
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,280
The Strix GPU is a three fan card.

547
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,360
And the GPU that we just picked up is a two fan.

548
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,840
So in theory, it should fit just fine.

549
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,360
So I don't think I would have to worry about that.

550
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,800
However, if you're building 
a rig with a very long GPU,

551
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,400
you're going to have to worry about that.

552
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,520
For real, for real.

553
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,200
Okay, with that said, the Cooler 
Master MasterBox Q300L looks amazing.

554
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,720
Though I'm going to pick up 
the white color because I am,

555
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
I'm a big fan of white colors, honestly.

556
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,720
And now we're going to get into 
the big hunk-a-dunk-a-dunk,

557
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,320
the power supply.

558
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,240
This is where things get a little bit scary.

559
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,800
But fret not, PCPartPicker 
has a power supply calculator

560
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,920
that does an estimate of power 
draw that you might need.

561
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,360
With that considered, it's 
estimated to have 331 watts.

562
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,640
You could just trail onto that number,

563
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,160
like say, pick up a 350, but 
I wouldn't recommend that.

564
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,560
Say if your processor ends up boosting, 
it's going to start speeding up a lot more.

565
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,480
That means it's going to take more 
power and then boom, we just lost power.

566
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,160
So it's always better to get 
above it than to go below it.

567
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,520
So with that in mind, I 
would highly recommend, well,

568
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,560
the old saying of the rule of 
thumb would be to double it.

569
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,520
I'm getting, I was so tempted to say 
"double it and give it to the next person".

570
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,160
Jesus, this is such a brain rot.

571
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,720
The old rule of thumb would be to 
double it and go by that number.

572
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,800
But power supplies these days 
have become efficient enough

573
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,600
that you won't have to worry too much.

574
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,240
Take that number, half it, 
and then plus on top of it.

575
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,640
So like say 331, we double it.

576
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,920
So 662, half it.

577
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,040
No, not half it.

578
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,600
Um, if we, no wait, half, half this number,

579
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,120
331 would be like somewhere around 160 or 150.

580
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,400
I can't do my math, but say 
roughly 400, 500 watts about that.

581
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,680
Somewhere around that number, 450 to 500 watts.

582
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,520
So I would personally recommend 
picking up a 500 watt then.

583
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,480
So we're going to start from 500 and go through...

584
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,840
I wouldn't say the cheapest because I 
wouldn't recommend going the cheapest.

585
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,240
In fact, I don't even know why I clicked on that.

586
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,120
That's stupid.

587
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,240
We're going to pick the top ratings for now.

588
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,200
Hold it right there.

589
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,960
There is another piece of paper 
that we have to reference right now.

590
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,240
We're going to create a new tab 
and search for [PSU tier list].

591
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,720
You're going to look for the one that's 
currently hosted on LinusTechTips.com.

592
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,280
Where the hell are you really?

593
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:19,680
And search for this from Linus Tech Tips 
Forum, the PSU tier list revision 16.1.

594
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,320
Though there are no newer that I am aware of.

595
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,120
So we can only stick with that for now

596
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,840
until Linus Tech Tips manages 
to finish testing all the PSUs

597
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,120
and have a very detailed list in LTT Labs.

598
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,000
This will be our current list that 
we're going to refer to for now.

599
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,160
But don't take it as gospel for now 
because when it comes to building PC parts,

600
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,960
you're going to have some degree of skepticism

601
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,320
when it comes to certain 
judgment of certain parts.

602
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,520
And everything you need to know, like 
an explanation, it's all up here.

603
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,640
So please have a good read of that 
before you go through the list.

604
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,120
Instead of going "Oh hey, tier 
A. We'll take these then."

605
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,400
Sometimes it's fine to go a little bit lower

606
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,560
as long as you're not going 
into the explosive region.

607
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,640
So what we want to look at is 
currently on the top rating,

608
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,760
we got ourselves Seasonic Focus (Plus) 650 
Gold, which is currently about 104 bucks.

609
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,960
We're going to keep scrolling down

610
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,320
and see what other power supplies 
we got that looks interesting to me.

611
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,640
Since we said we wanted 500 watts and 
we don't need any more than that really.

612
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,200
Okay, you know what, let's just set the 
filters to probably 650 to be the top.

613
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,800
That way we can keep our 
filters really really clean.

614
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,520
Right, EVGA.

615
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,960
Oh, I miss you EVGA, holy.

616
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,400
Let's have a look.

617
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,200
EVGA Supernova 550 G3.

618
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:40,160
Let's look through the list and 
CTRL + F, EVGA Supernova G3.

619
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,440
What tier are you from?

620
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
An A-tier.

621
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,240
How interesting.

622
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,920
Low priority units.

623
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,120
Though I'm not really too 
good at reading the tier list,

624
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,160
if it did end up on that high of the tier list,

625
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,840
I honestly think it would be pretty good.

626
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Though personally I would be picking 
up only Corsair or Cooler Master PSUs

627
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,800
because Seasonic is not available here sadly.

628
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,640
However, Linus has been 
sponsored by Seasonic so much

629
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,560
that they've built PCs with them so much.

630
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,720
Almost every build they got has been 
Seasonic, have you realized that?

631
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,400
That's freaking interesting, doesn't it?

632
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,920
If possible, I guess you can try out Seasonic

633
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,960
and be your own judge about this.

634
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,640
But I'm going to pick up the EVGA Supernova.

635
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,160
However, we can't really see the 
price at the moment for the 550W

636
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,000
so we're gonna pick up the 650W.

637
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,680
Wait a second, are there 
any 550W that has a price?

638
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Oh yeah, Corsair does but the prices 
are not really all too different

639
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,840
from the whole 100W difference.

640
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,800
So I'm gonna be picking up the EVGA 
Supernova G3 as the PSU for now.

641
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,120
Operating system, Windows 10 is gonna be 
dead because Microsoft being Microsoft.

642
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,760
Though I would personally 
give them Windows 11 Home.

643
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,560
But considering the $30 price difference,

644
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,760
I honestly think it's fine to pick up Pro.

645
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,280
Now we've got our price list populated,

646
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,600
that is at least without the 
monitor, without any other stuff,

647
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,280
without headphones, keyboards, mice 
and everything, just the PC itself.

648
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,160
We've kind of racked up close to a thousand bucks.

649
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,120
And honestly for a university student,

650
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,040
a thousand bucks is like quite a lot of money.

651
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,320
So we're gonna see what can we cut down

652
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,240
and we're gonna run through the list once more.

653
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,600
Considering earlier when we just 
mentioned that this person plays Apex.

654
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,040
So an Apex is particularly more of 
a CPU heavy game than over the GPU

655
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,240
and we would have to make sure 
that we hold on to the 12600K

656
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,760
because I don't think the 
12400 can hold on to Apex.

657
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,960
Personally, I don't really think so if you have

658
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,840
all the background services running as well.

659
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,840
So I much rather hold on to the 12600K.

660
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,200
So we're gonna keep going through the list

661
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,800
and see what else can we 
cut off from the price list.

662
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,560
Looking through the list, honestly I 
can't really think of what I can cut down.

663
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,360
Though if you do have a suggestion, 
let me know in the comments below.

664
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,800
But if the said university student isn't 
archiving too much of their assignments and stuff,

665
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,200
I think we can kind of just cut off that HDD.

666
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,240
Though it would be bad choice for many people,

667
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,880
but in my personal opinion I 
think that would be the choice.

668
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,720
I think we might be able to 
cut down on the CPU cooler

669
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,160
by picking a different model.

670
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,800
So if we're going through 
the lowest of the price list,

671
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,960
if we're going hardcore budget friendly,

672
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,800
we need something that 
actually still cools that thing

673
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,400
without anything stupid going on.

674
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,560
So going through the list, I can kind

675
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:23,120
of see ye-olde trusted Cooler Master Hyper 
212, but I think we can get better than that.

676
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
So we're gonna keep going through the list.

677
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,000
Wow, Amazon Basics cooler is here.

678
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,840
In case you don't know, Amazon Basics 
is basically a rebadged Hyper 212.

679
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,240
Now that I've looked through 
the budget section of the list,

680
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,800
I think the Hyper 212 would be a solid 
choice based on my past experience with them.

681
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,400
So let's see how much we have cut down.

682
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,520
Oh hey, we got down to 900 bucks.

683
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,240
So we've saved essentially just 100 bucks less.

684
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,880
Can we go any lower than that?

685
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,480
Probably.

686
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,200
We're gonna see what we can do with this.

687
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,280
Apex Legends is still quite a 
CPU heavy game though honestly,

688
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,040
but if that person knows when to 
turn off Firefox or Google Chrome

689
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,880
or whatever browser they're going to be using,

690
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,600
then I think dropping the CPU a little 
bit lower would be fine as well.

691
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,640
So we've already dropped the GPU, so 
might as well drop the CPU as well.

692
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,280
Let's see how much lower we can go.

693
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,760
Looking around the market, we 
could see that there's a 12400F.

694
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,000
Let's see what cores they got.

695
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,760
The 12400F has only six cores,

696
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,480
which is likely probably like 2E 
cores and 4P cores, or maybe just 4E.

697
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,840
You know what, let me just 
do a research real quick.

698
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,520
There's no fucking way right?

699
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,440
Oh, they're all P cores.

700
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
I see.

701
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,840
Though if we do pick it up, it 
would save us a whole lot of money.

702
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,400
The problem is that it's not 
really saving us that much

703
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,320
in terms of performance now, isn't it?

704
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,640
So honestly, considering how 
we're already having a GPU,

705
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,240
if we are really really tight on budget,

706
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,840
we would have to save 25 bucks 
by picking up the 12600KF.

707
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,480
So K means overclocked and F 
means without discrete graphics.

708
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,080
What's bad about the F series chips

709
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,680
is that you're not going to 
have integrated graphics,

710
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,800
which means for diagnosis purposes,

711
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,880
you're not going to have integrated graphics.

712
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,800
And this could be quite bad if you 
do run into like say a PCIe problem,

713
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,320
a graphics slot problem, and you 
have nothing to test out with

714
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,840
because if the slot don't 
work, you're not getting a GPU.

715
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,600
So that's kind of a problem with that sometimes.

716
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,080
Am I really going to sacrifice that?

717
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,640
Hmm, how's the 14600KF?

718
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,560
Oh, that's a whole lot more impressive.

719
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,240
Never mind then, forget I asked.

720
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,880
If this person trusts their technician more

721
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,800
and they're not doing any stupid shit, 
I think the 12400F would do fine.

722
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,280
I think they're going to 
struggle on Apex a little bit.

723
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,960
With a few changes we've made, we're 
gonna need to redetermine power supply.

724
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,080
Now we have a slightly shorter power budget.

725
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,680
So say 300, by half is 150.

726
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,960
So then uh 450.

727
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,920
So we could hunt out for power supplies 
that are slightly lower wattage now.

728
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,920
So we're gonna start with 450 
and end with 550 for the filters.

729
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,360
And let's look around the budget, but 
be wary of the of the popularity rates.

730
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,200
If possible, it would be nice to 
have some degree of 80 plus rating.

731
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,720
So like say bronze, silver, and 
gold, and anything above that.

732
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:17,040
Try to avoid the standard 80 plus 
because some of which are fakes.

733
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,560
If we're talking about the Chinese 
made ones, they're usually fakes.

734
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,960
Right, looking into the budget section,

735
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,280
we're gonna look into which one is it

736
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,920
that we have been very 
familiar with this whole time.

737
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,400
Seasonic 550 watt, 80 Plus Gold.

738
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,240
Looks pretty good.

739
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,920
A whole lot of ratings on 
Amazon, 12 of them particularly.

740
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,320
"This thing hasn't blown up so far."

741
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,400
- hoefetus_deletus

742
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,560
Looking at the reviews, there's 
a whole lot of people that

743
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,360
that said that it is pretty good.

744
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,920
So and it hasn't blown up on them I guess.

745
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,200
So I guess we could just kind of 
safely pick up that power supply.

746
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,080
Though Seasonic has already 
had a good deal of popularity,

747
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,400
so we're gonna pick that up.

748
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,360
And we basically save ourselves another 50 bucks.

749
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,640
So our final price at the moment is 754.

750
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,560
Now say I'm not giving Windows 11 Pro,

751
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,640
how about we give Windows 11 Home instead.

752
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,760
That saves us roughly 20 bucks.

753
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,280
Yeah, somewhere around there.

754
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,000
So we got a bit of savings.

755
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,800
Let's see how far can we go further.

756
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,640
When it comes to cases, you can pick 
pretty much any kind of cases honestly.

757
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,120
You can buy a trash can even.

758
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,240
If you're an engineer, we're going for it.

759
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,280
So earlier I talked about sizing.

760
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,640
Considering how we're on just try 
to stay within micro ATX or larger.

761
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,360
And currently as we see,

762
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,920
that MasterBox that we saw earlier 
is the one that we just picked.

763
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:43,320
However, for some weird reasons, Amazon 
has this fairly weird and unfamiliar case

764
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,720
that I have never seen before in 
my life, which is the DIYPC F2.

765
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,040
Judging by its price,

766
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,360
ooh, "Really cheap and feels like 
it would fall apart in any second.

767
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Fans are awful. Spend an extra 10 
bucks for a better case please."

768
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,520
Though a whole lot of other 
people are either positive

769
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,320
or just outright negative for this.

770
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,840
And honestly, I don't know.

771
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,080
You be the judge on whether it's 
worth saving 7 bucks from this.

772
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,240
Look at this. It's 47 bucks okay.

773
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,920
And then this is 40 bucks.

774
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,280
If you're willing to save 7 bucks, then go for it.

775
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,520
As far as I can say.

776
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,040
However, there are a whole lot 
of cheaper cases out there.

777
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,360
When I mean a whole lot, I mean 
like a whole whole whole lot.

778
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,000
You can easily find one for like 10 bucks even.

779
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,960
Just snag one.

780
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,440
Snag one somewhere at the side 
of the street or something.

781
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,120
But we're gonna pick this for now.

782
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,560
And this would be our final price.

783
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,160
$724.24.

784
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,920
And there you have it.

785
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,600
Here's my build mentality.

786
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,720
Now that we're done with the first person, 
we're gonna work on the second persons.

787
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,080
Okay, so earlier I said that 
we're gonna have four people.

788
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,920
I've looked back at the list and I 
realized that I don't need one of them.

789
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,520
So we're gonna do three people in total instead.

790
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,560
So let's get right into the second person.

791
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,280
So scrolling down, we're gonna see that 
the second person is an AI enthusiast.

792
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,560
Oh we're getting into AI right now.

793
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,720
Oh red flag, red alert, red alert.

794
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,320
Melori is an AI.

795
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,280
She is not real.

796
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,760
She is a robot.

797
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,880
Okay, jokes aside.

798
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,520
Presumably, this person 
wants to experiment with AI

799
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,960
to understand how AI things work.

800
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,960
So we're gonna give them basically 
pretty much the basics of AI I guess.

801
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,760
And considering no budget 
has been mentioned at all,

802
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,280
we're gonna go ham with it.

803
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,440
And saving money is not really an 
option for experimenting with AI.

804
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,720
So we're gonna get right into it.

805
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,560
Alright, let's clean up our workbench once more.

806
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,520
And we're gonna start with CPU.

807
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
So most stuff with AI,

808
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,120
particularly like say retrieval-based 
voice conversion, RVC,

809
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:44,400
or AI art, something along the 
lines of say stable diffusion,

810
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,720
or upscaling, something along the 
lines of using waifu2x and the like,

811
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,320
and maybe AI transcriptions, somewhere 
along the lines of StoryToolKitAI.

812
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,200
These all particularly used mostly GPU

813
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,640
because the GPU is the only one that's 
primarily capable of handling the task

814
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,200
due to their insanely high core count

815
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,360
in comparison to the core counts that 
you have on CPU, which is very little.

816
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:16,000
So we're gonna be really focused on 
the GPU side of things than the CPU.

817
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,800
All the CPU really needs to do is be 
a computer that facilitates all that

818
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,600
and compile the results I guess.

819
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,320
We're gonna start with CPU.

820
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,960
And usually you would have 
already been picking up on a CPU

821
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,360
that would handle a good deal of task.

822
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,240
So we're not gonna pick up 
Intel for the time being

823
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,640
because we're gonna need the core counts 
on every core to make good use of it.

824
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,200
So we're gonna be sticking to Ryzen for now.

825
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,840
This may sound stupid for most 
tech enthusiasts in my opinion,

826
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,200
but hear me out once more.

827
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,080
I'm sorry, my brain works in a way 
that I can't really teach you of.

828
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,080
It may sometimes be a little bit 
stupid, so please bear with me.

829
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,320
I may be very very cringe, I'm so sorry.

830
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,760
So we're gonna start with the 7th gen Ryzen

831
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,200
because we're gonna need pretty fast RAM,

832
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,160
at least fast in the sense that 
it's fast in megatransfers.

833
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,760
Because some AI tasks make 
good use of either the VRAM

834
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,480
or your system RAM or both.

835
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,640
So we're gonna need to be very 
prepared for both of them.

836
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,440
So we're gonna pick up the 7th gen 
Ryzen or even the 8th gen Ryzen.

837
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,680
Oh we're not picking up the 8600G.

838
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,560
Damn it AMD, what's wrong with you on the 8th gen?

839
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,520
Okay fine, we'll do the 7th gen.

840
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,920
So for this I'm going to 
recommend picking up the 7800X3D,

841
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,520
the most popular choice up here,

842
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,800
because we're gonna need most of the cores

843
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,120
and most of the level 3 cache if possible.

844
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,680
Basically use everything 
that's there, go ham with it.

845
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,360
And I'm not a big fan of liquid cooling honestly.

846
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,600
If you're going to go liquid cooling, 
then might as well go custom tubing

847
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:50,280
because AIO sometimes is way more of 
a pain to maintain than anything else.

848
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,640
It's like there's more complications 
with AIOs in my opinion.

849
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,760
So in my opinion, if you're perfectly 
fine with your current room environment,

850
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,480
you don't mind the size, you can 
absolutely pick up the gold standard,

851
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,200
the Noctua NH-D15.

852
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,040
And now we're gonna get into the motherboard.

853
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,600
This time we're gonna go ham.

854
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,480
When I mean ham, I mean go ham.

855
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,240
So we're gonna be picking up the X-series 
chips which is usually the higher ends of it.

856
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,480
You could just pick up the B-series chips

857
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,120
because there's really not too much affected here,

858
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,560
but we're gonna go ham with 
anything and everything.

859
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,400
So we're gonna pick up the X670s and 
let's see what's the popular choice.

860
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,480
The Gigabyte Aorus Elite.

861
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,760
Huh, interesting.

862
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,760
And the MSI Pro X670P WiFi.

863
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,480
Though we don't really need WiFi at the 
moment so I would happily pick that up.

864
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,320
Let's have a look at the VRM.

865
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:38,840
Ooh, heatsinked.

866
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,040
Nice.

867
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,120
It seems like we're in good business.

868
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,320
Right, so we're gonna pick up this baby

869
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,080
and we're getting straight to the memory.

870
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,680
So for some AI tasks,

871
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,200
they might end up using a little bit 
more system memory instead of the VRAM.

872
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,120
So we're gonna need to be ready for that.

873
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,160
So at least 32 gigs is, if 
anything, the bare minimum.

874
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,680
If you're doing something 
like AI training outright,

875
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,880
you're going to need a good deal of buffer.

876
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,280
I mean not too much of a buffer.

877
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,160
I mean like say if you do pick up a 
GPU with a very short amount of VRAM,

878
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,520
Windows at some point of time is 
going to reallocate those RAMs

879
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,440
to the system memory as like the backup measure.

880
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,040
So you're going to need some extra headroom.

881
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,520
So instead of the 16 that I just mentioned, 
I'd rather you pick up 32 gig personally.

882
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,720
So we're gonna start there.

883
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,480
DDR5 and we're gonna pick up two sticks of 16

884
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,760
so we can make good use of the dual channel.

885
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,720
And this is where we can decide on the speed.

886
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,200
We're gonna go with a little 
bit of a populous choice

887
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,480
over budget options instead.

888
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,520
And we can clearly see that

889
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,800
there's a good deal of Vengeance 
users and a G.Skill Trident Z Neo.

890
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,800
So looking through the prices, 
this is much faster in RAM speeds

891
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,760
and it has slightly lower latency as well.

892
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,160
So I would pick that up absolutely.

893
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,480
Right, storage.

894
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,080
Depending on what you're working on,

895
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,000
if you're training AI, we're 
gonna need a lot of space.

896
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,280
Like say approximately going into the hundreds.

897
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,080
Maybe if you're training AI art, you're 
going to need way more than that.

898
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,880
But if you're training like 
say AI voices like RVC,

899
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,680
then you would probably only need ever so little.

900
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,240
Like roughly around the tens.

901
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,600
So we're gonna swing in 
between of those two extremes

902
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,000
and stick with I'd say one terabyte of NVMe SSDs.

903
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,840
We're gonna make sure we leave 
no bottlenecks for AI operations.

904
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,480
So we're gonna start with 
1000 and end that with 2000.

905
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,800
You can buy more HDDs in the future if you want

906
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,000
or more SSDs in the future 
if you do run out of space.

907
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,880
But use this as your boot drive.

908
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,760
It would be nice.

909
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,600
And we're gonna stick with the 980 Pro.

910
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,000
Oh hey, look in the same price.

911
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,120
We got the 990 Pro which usually is much faster.

912
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,400
If anything, an upgrade from the 980.

913
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,800
Oh hey, it's the two terabyte.

914
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,680
To those who are picking 
up the 980 or the 990 Pro,

915
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,240
please update your firmware immediately 
when you're done installing Windows

916
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,840
because there is a fatal chip-killing bug 
on the initial firmware of these drives.

917
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,080
You have been warned.

918
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,640
Right, following that, this is 
where we get real serious about it.

919
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,080
Usually with AI workloads,

920
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:14,120
you would want to use some sort 
of workstation GPUs of some sort.

921
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,280
But considering this person is just an enthusiast,

922
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,400
we're gonna give them consumer GPUs for now

923
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,360
because workstation GPUs are a little 
bit on the side of being a bit overpriced

924
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,960
for the power that it provides.

925
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,600
Primarily because of the price premium 
and the fact that it has ECC sometimes.

926
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,240
And primarily the fact that it is made 
for specialized workloads like that.

927
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,000
Like AI and working on editing videos and stuff.

928
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,160
Basically specialist workloads I guess.

929
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,200
But the consumer GPUs are usually just fine.

930
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,280
And since we're talking about efficiency,

931
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,360
depending on how heavy this 
AI enthusiast is looking at,

932
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,280
we could probably give them a 4080 or a 4070.

933
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,320
So we could play around with that.

934
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,760
Though with my personal experience,

935
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,520
the 3060 is just as good 
for experimenting with AI.

936
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,560
Like if you're just a consumer, an AI 
consumer rather than an AI trainer,

937
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,680
then I think the 3060 is 
absolutely perfect for it.

938
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,360
But let's say if we want to play around 
in the middle of the two extremes,

939
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,760
between just a consumer and a trainer.

940
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,840
What if you want to be on the middle of it

941
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,800
and you still want to dip your 
toes into AI and stuff like that.

942
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,000
I say be on the middle.

943
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,320
So I would say somewhere around 
the 4070s or the 4070 Super.

944
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,720
So I would give them 4070Ti Super.

945
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,200
Let's see if there's any pretty good ones.

946
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,680
Let's see if there's anything 
really popular by the ratings.

947
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,840
Oh, Asus TUF.

948
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,240
It's been a while since I last heard you.

949
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:40,840
Holy.

950
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,960
There's 16 gigs of VRAM, which is pretty nice.

951
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,120
It is not much, but it would do.

952
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,560
The reason why I say it's not much 
is because on my personal experience

953
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,080
with being an AI art consumer,

954
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:56,400
as in the sense of we just 
create content using AI models,

955
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,280
that in itself has taken 
quite a lot of RAM actually.

956
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,800
Having 16 gigs or more would be very, very nice,

957
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,560
but we can hold on to that for now.

958
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,600
Also to make things really, really clear,

959
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,120
I don't use AI art for commercial reasons.

960
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,920
I'm only using it to experiment 
things and understand how they work.

961
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,800
Use AI models ethically.

962
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,200
And that has been the public service announcement

963
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,240
brought to you by MeloriTensei.

964
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,440
Right, continuing on.

965
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,320
A case.

966
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,200
Well, airflow would matter a lot.

967
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:28,800
So we're going straight to 
the Corsair 400d airflow.

968
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,760
And power supply.

969
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,560
We're going to need to worry 
about power supply from here on

970
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,920
because AI workload is a really 
power intensive operation

971
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,600
and it's estimated wattage is about 566 watts.

972
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,120
If we do the same rule of 
thumb that I just mentioned,

973
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,640
which is half that and then plus 
over the top of the original number,

974
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,640
you would get yourself somewhere 
around the range of 700-ish.

975
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,760
So we're going to go a little bit above that.

976
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,080
We're going to take 800 watts as a starting point

977
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,520
and we're going to hold on to that for now.

978
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,160
So we're currently being 
recommended with Corsair RM850e,

979
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,280
which is an 80 Plus Gold, 850 watt power 
supply, which looks pretty decent, honestly.

980
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,240
Though if you can find any power 
supply that's safer than that

981
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,760
or more power efficient than 
that, like say 80 Plus Platinum,

982
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,200
I would highly recommend picking those up instead.

983
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,560
Or even Titanium.

984
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,360
So like say that be quiet! Dark 
Power that has 80 Plus Titanium.

985
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,560
But we don't really need 1000 watts 
for that kind of build at the moment.

986
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,400
But if you do want to future proof 
it, this would be a good choice.

987
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,680
But what I'm currently looking at is, um,

988
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,800
say probably, what if I want to 
lock it down to strictly 850?

989
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,680
Will we be able to find a 
titanium around that price?

990
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,880
Oh, yes we do.

991
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,840
There is a be quiet! Dark Power, 
80 Plus Titanium, 850 watt.

992
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,800
"Mel, you didn't tell us, you've been 
talking about 80 Plus this, 80 Plus that,

993
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,760
but you haven't really explained what 80 Plus is."

994
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,760
80 Plus is basically just the 
percentage of power efficiency

995
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,320
when it comes from the wall

996
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,600
and then in comparison to how 
much it's actually coming out

997
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,120
of the power supply to the parts.

998
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,200
So 80 Plus is basically just a saying 
of "it is 80 percent plus efficient".

999
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,200
So like say there is a bit 
of 20 percent power loss

1000
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,280
and there inside the power supply itself

1001
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,880
after some like voltage conversions and stuff.

1002
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,720
But what you have to worry 
about is the word after it.

1003
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,280
That determines its efficiency rate.

1004
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,080
So Titanium is the absolute top, 
the most efficient basically.

1005
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,680
So what we want is, we're going 
to pick up 80 Plus Titanium,

1006
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,520
which means we're going to have the most 
efficient of power flow into the computer.

1007
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,440
And operating system wise, 
depending if you are using Linux

1008
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,120
or are you using Windows, this would differ a lot.

1009
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,480
But I think this person 
would likely be dual booting,

1010
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,040
so we're going to give them Windows 11 Pro.

1011
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,760
And with that, we've settled 
with the price range of $2206.79.

1012
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,040
That is interestingly expensive in my opinion.

1013
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,720
However, if you're willing to pay that 
kind of price for experimenting with AI,

1014
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,120
I say go for it.

1015
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,520
Because this kind of build is kind of 
a bit future proofing in my opinion.

1016
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,280
Because for me, I like the processor 
to be a tad ahead of the GPU.

1017
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,080
When we do fall behind in the times and 
we do only end up upgrading the GPU,

1018
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,880
the CPU is not falling behind.

1019
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,520
And we will still be able to 
do the workload that we want.

1020
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,960
So this is also why you would 
see me picking processors

1021
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,640
that are a little bit over 
what the GPU can handle.

1022
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,680
Future proofing has been in 
my mentality this whole time.

1023
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,360
So yeah, there we have it.

1024
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,960
$2206.79

1025
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,760
Here we go.

1026
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,720
Right, let's get on to the third person.

1027
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,400
Right, let's see what we got.

1028
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,600
Third person.

1029
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,760
Oh...

1030
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,520
Third person.

1031
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,880
A rhythm gamer.

1032
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,480
Plays mostly osu!, Project Heartbeat, 
Beat Saber, Project Diva Megamix,

1033
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,840
and SoundVoltex Konasute version.

1034
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,200
So if you don't know what 
SoundVoltex Konasute version means,

1035
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,520
it basically means the arcade game 
SoundVoltex if you've heard of it.

1036
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,920
It's actually a game where you 
have a series of four buttons

1037
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,200
and two more in the lower layer 
and two not on the upper end.

1038
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,400
It's a really cool rhythm game.

1039
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,960
I highly recommend you check it out.

1040
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,800
So SoundVoltex made a home arcade version.

1041
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,640
So basically you still have 
to pay them to play the game,

1042
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,120
but you get to play them at 
home over online, I guess.

1043
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,960
And according to some people, 
you can actually save money

1044
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,720
by subscribing to it on a subscription basis.

1045
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,800
If you do play it almost every 
day and very, very often,

1046
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,600
this could save you more money 
than you spend tokens on it.

1047
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,000
And also big shout out to Harukawa Zinta.

1048
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,120
That's my good friend that I found when 
he was streaming SoundVoltex as well.

1049
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,920
Do check him out.

1050
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,800
Link in the description.

1051
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,880
Right, let's get into cleaning up our 
board and let's get straight to it.

1052
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,440
So I'm not too worried about Beat 
Saber, Project Diva, all the other games

1053
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,880
because these games are 
really easy to take care of.

1054
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,800
What I'm worried about is osu! itself.

1055
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,240
Because osu! in my personal experience on 
this past many years that I've played for,

1056
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,000
you might have seen me play that game on 
stream during my previous Donathon last year.

1057
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,960
That game in particular is a hell for me to manage

1058
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,200
because this game is really CPU sensitive.

1059
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,520
If you have too many background 
services running in the background,

1060
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,720
this game can give you hell with input latency

1061
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,240
and stutters will happen if 
you are really choked on CPU.

1062
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,120
So CPU becomes a heavily 
important portion of things

1063
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,080
and we're gonna keep that very strictly in mind.

1064
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,200
But considering a rhythm gamer 
is usually just a casual gamer,

1065
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,520
we're gonna start worrying about the CPU first.

1066
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,320
Then we'll worry about everything else later.

1067
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:25,240
So starting first, it would be very very 
nice to separate the P-Cores and the E-Cores

1068
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,800
so that Windows will be managed on the E-Cores

1069
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,600
and the game would be deadly 
focused on the P-Cores.

1070
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,240
So the Intel's recent series, the Intel 14th Gen,

1071
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,680
would be a great candidate for that.

1072
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,440
Sadly, I'm so sorry fellow guys.

1073
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:46,040
The problem is that hitching is a 
real pain for every rhythm gamer.

1074
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,360
So we will have to worry about that.

1075
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:54,720
So we're gonna look into Core i7, 
i9, and i7 Extreme just in case.

1076
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,880
And we're gonna look into…

1077
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,120
oh damn, I can't really 
read the core family names.

1078
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,000
We're gonna look into the 14th Gen like this.

1079
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,920
14.

1080
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,320
There we go.

1081
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:10,320
And I can kind of see that the 14700K and 
the 14900K are the most popular choices

1082
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,240
but we're gonna compare between the two

1083
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,240
because I don't think one would 
spend this amount of money

1084
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,000
for a 14900K just for a rhythm game.

1085
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,560
So we're gonna have a careful good look at it.

1086
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,200
So the 14700K has um…

1087
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,960
let's see, 20 core count.

1088
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,760
Okay now that we're on 
Intel's page for the 14700K,

1089
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,800
we can see that they're giving 
it 8 P-Cores and 12 E-Cores

1090
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,400
which is kind of good in my opinion

1091
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,680
because Windows would have a lot more cores

1092
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,280
to manage their background services 
horseshit tomfoolery around.

1093
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,880
With the 8 cores all left for osu! to manage.

1094
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,000
Which is kind of good stuff because for osu!

1095
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,880
in particularly, more cores 
doesn't necessarily mean good.

1096
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,800
But with multi-threading enabled, 
it can benefit it to some degree

1097
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,440
as long as these cores are not 
being occupied by anything else.

1098
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,120
So we have a whole lot of 
breathing room from here.

1099
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,160
When I mean a whole lot, I mean 
like a whole whole whole lot.

1100
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,760
That means we don't really need that 14900K.

1101
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,480
We can go any lower than that if 
we wish to save money from here.

1102
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,800
So the price for this would be $389.99.

1103
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,200
So we're gonna go see if we can 
find anything lower than that.

1104
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,800
How about 14600 in some sense?

1105
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,400
There's no 6 yet?

1106
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,960
Aww, drat.

1107
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,760
Fine, the 14700K is the only choice.

1108
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,480
We could go with the 13s but we're 
gonna stick with future proofing for now

1109
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,400
because this is going to be a real problem

1110
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,840
if this rhythm gamer does not wish 
to upgrade for another five years.

1111
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,280
Right, CPU cooler, we can worry about you later.

1112
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,480
We're getting straight to the motherboard first.

1113
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,280
So the 14700K is an overclockable chip

1114
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,040
so it would be a great added bonus to 
be able to have a Z series chipset.

1115
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,480
But it is also fine to pick up a B series chipset

1116
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,240
if you're not planning to overclock it.

1117
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,360
But there is a slim chance that 
you might end up overclocking

1118
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,920
on this kind of setup so it is always advisable

1119
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,280
to pick up a Z series chipset for this one.

1120
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,520
Right, getting on to the memory,

1121
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,280
we're gonna hop back here and find out 
how much is it supported officially.

1122
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:09,260
With DDR5, it only supports up to 
5600MT/s which admittedly is a little bit

1123
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:13,800
ehhhh... a little bit slow 
but we can overclock it right?

1124
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,960
So according to the general market,

1125
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:21,480
6000MT/s is the usual sweet 
spot for overclocked gaming

1126
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,960
so we're gonna pick that speed up.

1127
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,360
And in terms of RAM amounts,

1128
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,120
if this person knows how to manage 
their background processors,

1129
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,880
I don't think we would need that much of RAM.

1130
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,480
Probably 16GB would be more than enough honestly.

1131
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,920
But since this person only 
plays rhythm games on this PC,

1132
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,320
we would be giving what's best for 
them, those channels with 16GB.

1133
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,480
That's it, very simple, we don't need to say much.

1134
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,560
But in terms of speed though, 
we're gonna give 6000MT/s.

1135
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,200
Let's see what they got.

1136
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,320
6000, 6000, 6000, 6000!

1137
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,280
That's the only absolute top that we can find.

1138
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,440
And currently on the budget line, we 
currently got the Kingston Fury Beast.

1139
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,560
Sounds interesting.

1140
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,600
And interestingly enough, if I 
just look below it a little bit,

1141
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:02,640
there's a slightly shorter latency version 
of it at the cost of what, 4 bucks?

1142
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,800
Yeah, just 4 bucks.

1143
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,080
If you're willing to take that trade 
off, I say pick this up instead.

1144
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,480
It's not too bad really.

1145
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,200
Now let's get into the CPU cooler.

1146
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,880
Cooling the 14700K is going 
to be one hell of a moment.

1147
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,120
It says processor base power at 125W.

1148
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,560
Considering how we're going 
to cool a space heater,

1149
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,560
we're going to need to worry 
about cooling a whole lot more

1150
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,800
and remember when I say how an AIO is a hassle?

1151
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,600
Admittedly it is a hassle

1152
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:34,280
but if you're going to build once and 
forget forever, I say the AIO is fine.

1153
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,600
It's just, if you live in a tropical 
country or a very very hot country,

1154
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,280
chances are there might be 
an extremely slim chance

1155
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,160
that water may or may not 
evaporate through the tubes.

1156
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,640
At least that's what happened 
with my personal experience

1157
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,120
and I heard a bit of gurgling on my AIO.

1158
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,800
Maybe I'm just unlucky with 
my own AIO and something

1159
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,920
and I'm just hating on AIOs like a stupid Karen.

1160
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,040
Okay, with that said, let's have a good look

1161
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,200
at what I've known for a 
long time, the NZXT Kraken.

1162
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,680
Let's see if it can handle the thermal 
design power that it's meant for.

1163
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,960
Usually if you do have a 
baseline for other computers,

1164
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,600
you can have a look at the reviews of some 
other processors based off what you know.

1165
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,120
However, Intel itself is a 
space heater so the 7600X is

1166
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,800
not really close at all when it comes 
to the TDP or thermal design power

1167
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,240
or basically the amount of heat 
is dissipating in wattages.

1168
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,680
So we'll probably have to get out 
of our way and actually Google it.

1169
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,920
You may be wondering why I've 
been calling Intel a space heater.

1170
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,360
That's because my previous processor was a 7700K

1171
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,880
and that thing is really really hot.

1172
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,760
It's so hard to tame the Noctua 
NH-D15 on that processor.

1173
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,000
It's like trying to tame a dragon

1174
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,480
but that dragon just keeps screaming 
at your face for no reason.

1175
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,080
And for some interesting reasons,

1176
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,280
I looked at reviews for the more recent processors

1177
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,520
and it seems like Intel hasn't learned a 
thing or two about improving their processors.

1178
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,640
Now looking at the compatibility 
from NZXT themselves,

1179
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:05,480
it is said that they're 
compatible with Core i9, i7.

1180
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,560
That's all we need to hear honestly.

1181
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:11,480
However, it would be nice if we got 
to see the TDP that they're supported

1182
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,800
in the sense that if they're able 
to cool down a certain level of TDP,

1183
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,160
that would have been a great nice thing to see.

1184
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,080
But I think this would be fine because

1185
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,520
considering rhythm games are 
not really a stress tool,

1186
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,080
I think this should do fine.

1187
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,640
Right, following that storage, rhythm 
games usually have a good load of beatmaps,

1188
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,360
say particularly for osu! and 
Project Heartbeat players.

1189
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,400
There will be a lot of community beatmaps

1190
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,080
and you're going to be downloading a lot,

1191
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,320
so I would say you need at least 1TB of storage

1192
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,480
or 500 if you're really tight on the budget,

1193
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,800
but 1TB is always the way to go.

1194
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,600
I would have recommended the Kingston NV2,

1195
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,080
but if we're going ham on the speed,

1196
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,440
it would be best for you to 
pick up the 970 EVO PLUS.

1197
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,880
It has amazing boot speed, amazing 
load speed, and durability?

1198
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,520
God-send sometimes.

1199
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,120
So I highly recommend that.

1200
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:05,360
In fact, my current PC currently 
has the 970 EVO non-plus,

1201
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,960
but it is still very very good and 
it boots really quickly as well,

1202
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,520
so I highly recommend that.

1203
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,880
It has great reputations.

1204
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,640
You don't have to bat an eye at 
the others, the 980 or the 990s,

1205
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,800
because the performance curve is going 
to get really really thin from there on,

1206
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:24,960
so I guess this would be a perfect middle 
ground for having a premium and fast SSD.

1207
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,800
GPU.

1208
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,040
Now this is where we'll have to 
worry a teeny tiny bit about this,

1209
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,920
because Beat Saber is mentioned.

1210
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,280
Even though every other game 
like osu! and Project Heartbeat,

1211
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,240
they don't take as much, you 
could easily pick up a 3060.

1212
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,600
Beat Saber in particular, 
depending on your VR headset,

1213
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:46,600
say if you're picking up the Valve Index 
or 5k and above resolution VR headsets,

1214
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:51,000
you will have to start worrying a 
little bit about graphics really.

1215
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,040
So personally, I would recommend 
picking up more than a 3060,

1216
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,520
so I say somewhere around the 4070s and onwards.

1217
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:04,160
Probably 4070 Super, at least that 
would be my personal recommendations,

1218
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,560
but you can go higher than 
that and it would be fine.

1219
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,440
But the absolute lowest, I would say 4070.

1220
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,680
So judging by the absolute cheapest 
that we can find, Zotac Twin.

1221
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,720
Hmm, I've heard of you Zotac.

1222
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:23,240
I was just about to buy you until 
someone came up and undercut him.

1223
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:23,960
Guess who?

1224
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,960
It's Palit, my current 3060.

1225
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,840
Okay, let's have a look at Zotac Twin Edge.

1226
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,080
I think it would be fine performance-wise.

1227
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,760
The cheapest 4070 Super I can grab in my country.

1228
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,360
Ooh, interesting.

1229
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:43,440
I think that would be the cheapest 
4070 Super in my area as well,

1230
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,560
but I don't know, you be the judge for that.

1231
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:50,040
If you're looking for a hard budget at 
a higher-end GPU, this is the way to go.

1232
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,360
Right, on to the case.

1233
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,520
I don't think you would have 
to worry as much honestly.

1234
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,560
You can pick up any kind of case honestly.

1235
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,880
As long as they fit, you'll be fine.

1236
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:02,800
And lucky for you, PC Part 
Picker grays out these case sizes

1237
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,120
that don't fit on your motherboard at all.

1238
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,600
So you can just pick the ones 
that fits, which is perfect.

1239
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:13,000
And I've had kind of not so good 
experience with NZXT's case,

1240
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,920
particularly the H510i

1241
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:19,120
because the H510i was a bit of a 
cooling choke to say the least.

1242
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,400
And it's a negative pressure case,

1243
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,320
which means you would want the 
airflow to be exhausting only.

1244
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,080
No intakes, just exhaust.

1245
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,120
Let the natural air do the intake kind of thing.

1246
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:34,680
But I can clearly tell that NZXT 
has started learning their lessons

1247
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,320
and started making the Flow series cases.

1248
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:41,880
So the Flow series basically is 
the same as their predecessors,

1249
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,680
but with meshes on the front.

1250
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,120
So that means air now don't only come 
from a tiny hole on the side here,

1251
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,440
but they all come from the front, which is good.

1252
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,760
Props to you, NZXT.

1253
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,680
And not to mention, this is a mid-tower case.

1254
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:56,240
That means it fits most 
parts of the rooms just fine.

1255
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,160
So I guess it would be a 
perfect case for them then.

1256
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,120
The H5 Flow would be nice.

1257
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,400
Right, getting into power supply.

1258
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,160
There's mostly boost clocks 
than anything full clock.

1259
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,480
So I would say you could 
just go a little bit higher,

1260
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,680
like say 750 watts and you do just perfectly fine.

1261
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:20,440
So 750 watts and set that limit 
to 800 as the absolute top.

1262
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,200
Right, let's see what's popular.

1263
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,440
Ooh, Corsair stands on top once more.

1264
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,440
Ooh, how interesting.

1265
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,760
The SFX power supply.

1266
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,840
Though SFX basically means it a 
little bit shorter than the ATX

1267
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,520
and it's mostly for slim 
builds that are for tiny cases.

1268
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:40,760
I'm not really too sure if SFX power 
supply can actually fit into ATX cases.

1269
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,280
So thread with caution.

1270
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,880
Not to mention you have to 
face with this price premium

1271
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,560
for the small size on top of 
having 80 Plus Platinum rating.

1272
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,560
So we're going to look into 
the next few best ones.

1273
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:56,360
Hey, our little friend Seasonic 
is back with 750 watts, $84.99.

1274
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,280
That's interesting, right?

1275
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,280
We'll pick that up.

1276
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,720
Oh yeah, here we go.

1277
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,880
Operating systems.

1278
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,960
Windows 11 Home.

1279
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,560
I'm not giving two flipping 
fucks about what they care.

1280
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,600
You are getting Home.

1281
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,200
You're going to stay at home!

1282
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:09,920
Just joking.

1283
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,800
If you do want to up the price a little,

1284
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,560
then you will be fine to pick up a Pro,

1285
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,400
but that would in turn bring up the price

1286
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:20,520
because currently our price range is really, 
really on a stellar high moment of $1809.

1287
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:25,360
And we got a CPU strong sided setup 
with a little bit of GPU strong as well.

1288
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,480
Like a, I wouldn't say "strong", but 
like a GPU mid to heavy kind of side.

1289
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,240
And also a little bit of a 
really high end motherboard,

1290
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,680
maybe a bit overkill for just rhythm gaming,

1291
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,960
but say in the future, like five years later,

1292
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,840
what if this guy wants to keep 
this very setup and not upgrade?

1293
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,080
So this person can just 
overclock away and just go at it.

1294
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,360
Sure, the current price premium 
sucks, but think about this.

1295
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,640
If you have the salary for 
it, feel free to pick it up.

1296
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,920
But if you don't, it's fine to 
go back to the B-series chipsets.

1297
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,800
No one's going to offend you for that.

1298
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,400
If there's anyone bullying you for that, tell me,

1299
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:04,760
because it's perfectly fine to use B-series 
chipsets on an overclockable processor.

1300
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,360
If you're there for the higher boost speeds

1301
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:11,920
or at least a better path to upgrade, 
maybe say you're just saving up.

1302
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,440
So you cheap out on the motherboard.

1303
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,920
So you wait till the market price goes down and

1304
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,680
you pick up this same motherboard 
at a way cheaper price.

1305
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,880
You basically save yourself more money again.

1306
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,280
So there's that.

1307
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,880
Of course you have to sell the old board first

1308
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,000
to be considered saving money to say the least.

1309
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,200
But yeah, $1809.42.

1310
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,560
That's still quite a little bit 
extra expensive in my opinion.

1311
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,840
My kind of builds are usually 
on a higher price admittedly

1312
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:39,400
because how I like recommending 
future-proofing a lot of the setups.

1313
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,080
And I don't really like, you know,

1314
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,800
making do with what's current

1315
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,120
because you end up finding yourself 
changing them every two years.

1316
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,920
And that's usually not my mentality

1317
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,240
because I like a PC to be 
lasting about five to six years

1318
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,840
and you only change a part 
every so of that interval.

1319
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,320
Otherwise, I genuinely wouldn't recommend that.

1320
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,640
So unless you're building like 
something like an office computer,

1321
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,520
then going ham on the budget is perfectly fine

1322
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,000
as long as you're not 
cheaping out on the processor

1323
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,200
because the processor is what 
keeps the entire computer together.

1324
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,840
And you can cheap out on the GPU.

1325
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,800
That's perfectly fine.

1326
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,120
You're only doing Excel sheets.

1327
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,160
You don't need a 1050 for an Excel sheet.

1328
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,000
But don't cheap out on the processor.

1329
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,080
You're going to regret it five 
years later in my opinion.

1330
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:26,520
With that said, here are my three 
different kinds of build mentality

1331
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,920
for how I would build PCs for 
these three different people.

1332
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,160
At least three different fictional people.

1333
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,280
And let me know what you 
think in the comments below.

1334
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:38,800
Be sure to press Like if you do like 
to see more of MeloriTensei content,

1335
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,080
tech, gaming, any kinds of 
sorts, probably even vlogs.

1336
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,720
I like doing tech videos here and there like that.

1337
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,560
So I hope you enjoy because my 
knowledge is still very very limited.

1338
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,840
I'm not as knowledgeable as 
Linus Tech Tips, JayzTwoCents,

1339
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,440
Paul's Hardware, Bitwit, and the like.

1340
01:05:54,440 --> 01:06:00,520
But I hope that my knowledge is 
of anything remotely helpful.

1341
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,160
So with that said, thank you so much for watching.

1342
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:03,969
See you guys next time.

1343
01:06:03,969 --> 01:06:05,043
OtsuMelo deshita (It's been ya girl Mel)!

1344
01:06:05,043 --> 01:06:07,465
See ya!

1345
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,000
uuuuugh!
