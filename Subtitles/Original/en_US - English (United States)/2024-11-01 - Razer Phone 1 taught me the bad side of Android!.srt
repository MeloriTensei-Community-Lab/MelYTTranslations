1
00:00:00,516 --> 00:00:02,860
You can tell I'm trying to keep up,

2
00:00:02,866 --> 00:00:06,760
but I'm still editing the previous video as I'm filming this video.

3
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:10,080
Welcome to behind the scenes I suppose.

4
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:10,910
Kon-Melo.

5
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:14,710
This time round, this is going to be a very very different video.

6
00:00:14,716 --> 00:00:17,680
So, it's again, once again one of those story time videos

7
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:19,560
that you saw in the previous video.

8
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:21,260
But, I'm going to be talking about a device

9
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:24,280
that is not alive anymore in the hands.

10
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:27,190
It's pretty much dead, so I can't really turn it on.

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,130
So this is going to be a really, really short video.

12
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:33,450
But, this is going to be a video that is going to get you understand

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,430
how I'm feeling that led to this device being quite dead.

14
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,760
It's a Razer Phone 1.

15
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:42,480
That's right.

16
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:45,580
So I bought into the old Razer Phone 1

17
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,230
because I thought to myself, man, Razer made cool product.

18
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, at least that's what the innocent part of me used to say

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,630
before I learned the anarchy of businesses.

20
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:58,030
So, once I picked up the Razer Phone 1,

21
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,810
it was a pretty pleasant experience from the get go.

22
00:01:00,816 --> 00:01:04,160
It was really smooth because it was one of the first phones

23
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,330
to have a higher refresh rate display.

24
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:10,660
And, it had a pretty decent Snapdragon 835.

25
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,060
So with a Snapdragon 835, it was pretty fast,

26
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,780
it was pretty lightning snappy smooth.

27
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:19,160
And, I was able to enjoy pretty much any games at smooth 60

28
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,250
with little to no issue.

29
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,580
Except, there may be some issues relating to the body of the device.

30
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:31,110
So, this Razer Phone is entirely made out of aluminum on the outside.

31
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:34,650
So, it's kind of heat conductive to many aspects.

32
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,510
So, when I was gaming on Honkai Impact,which was at the time

33
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:42,960
one of the most graphically demanding games on a mobile phone.

34
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:47,210
The vapor chamber cooling that was apparently in there was kind of cool.

35
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:50,010
It was working as expected really really quick.

36
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:53,500
But, it was getting really toasty and painful for my hands.

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,060
So, what did the naive little Mel did

38
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:59,340
to ensure that the cooling is consistent and everything?

39
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:00,480
She grabbed ice.

40
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:03,610
Put ice onto the phone.

41
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:06,760
Now, this is not what killed the phone however.

42
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:10,880
That was just what the past me did stupidly.

43
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:14,060
But, we'll get into what really killed the phone soon.

44
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:16,360
The phone really was amazing because it sounds amazing

45
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:20,760
albeit with Dolby Atmos and some enhancements on it.

46
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:24,630
But, it was a pretty well-rounded phone except for its software.

47
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:28,280
So, its software came in was pretty much a clean stock Android

48
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:32,660
with a few Razer additions to the built-in software.

49
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:37,130
So, like it came with Razer dedicated Dolby Atmos.

50
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:41,190
And, that's not much it honestly.

51
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,460
Yeah, I gotta be honest.

52
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,760
It's really really clean stock Android.

53
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:48,130
However, one thing I do not like about Android manufacturers

54
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:53,530
is their non-commitment to security updates.

55
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:56,410
Like I don't care if you don't add any features to it.

56
00:02:56,416 --> 00:03:02,030
But, do some security updates because this is where the first realization

57
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:04,900
of Android business anarchy taught me.

58
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,760
So, my bank called me and told me

59
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:11,710
that my phone is slightly out of date in its security updates.

60
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:15,430
And, they want to make sure that I'm constantly connected with the bank app.

61
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:20,660
So, they told me that the next update is going to enforce this new

62
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:24,530
security restrictions where it checks for the update patch

63
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,010
that this current Android is on.

64
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:31,230
And that blocks devices with updates that are far behind over a year.

65
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:34,910
And, at that time I did my check and I realized that Razer

66
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,510
has not updated Android for nearly a year.

67
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:40,160
It was crazy long.

68
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,530
So, then I realized, okay, what do I do?

69
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:44,760
We can't just not use the bank app.

70
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,260
I gotta move money around.

71
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:49,110
So, with not many other options behind,

72
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:51,030
at that time I don't really have any other phones.

73
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:53,690
This was the only phone.

74
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:57,380
I brought my old iPhone back into my pocket

75
00:03:57,383 --> 00:04:00,410
and its only job is to use the bank app.

76
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,930
It's not being my daily driver.

77
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:02,730
No, no, no.

78
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:04,060
It's not doing any of the sort.

79
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:07,310
All it does is be my bank app.

80
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:10,310
You may think it sounds stupid, but think about this.

81
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,730
It's an iPhone 6.

82
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:12,830
It's starting to get old.

83
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,260
It's starting to get a little chuggy chuggy laggy.

84
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,880
How would you expect me to move everything back there

85
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,160
and daily drive it again?

86
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,460
Especially when the battery was very very dead.

87
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:23,730
I mean, if you have seen my videos,

88
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:27,680
you will realize that I exchanged this battery just this year.

89
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:30,690
So, you could tell how dead that battery was.

90
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:33,640
So, it was kind of disappointing to me and I thought to myself,

91
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,600
"okay, maybe I could do something about it."

92
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,210
Maybe I could delve into the custom Android ROM.

93
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:39,780
Maybe that could help me a little.

94
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:44,830
However, here's another problem I have with Razer at that time.

95
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,910
They had really poor quality control

96
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,860
for the software implementation of the phone.

97
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:54,100
Or if I want to put it in the more advanced way,

98
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,030
the bootloader and the recovery is broken.

99
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,080
From the factory.

100
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,850
Broken from the factory.

101
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,280
How is that possible?

102
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:04,980
All I wanted to do was flash a new update or at least

103
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:07,360
have a clean flash of the stock ROM.

104
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:13,010
And that alone, the flashing script alone, bricked this phone.

105
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:14,960
Because, you want to know why?

106
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:17,410
So, what happened was, when I was flashing,

107
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:21,010
I realized that this phone can only accept one command at a time.

108
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:23,660
And it cannot accept a series of commands.

109
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:27,030
Which is what the install all script was supposed to do.

110
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:29,850
If you look into the zip file of the stock ROM,

111
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,460
you would see that inside there is an install-all.sh.

112
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,280
That's the script you're supposed to be running

113
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:36,910
to flash pretty much everything.

114
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,330
It's kind of pretty much what Project Treble

115
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,630
was supposed to do top to bottom.

116
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,730
With the vendor...

117
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:46,980
with the vendor drivers, system image, bootloader, everything.

118
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:48,430
All in a sequence.

119
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:53,160
Unfortunately, it froze midway and then it cuts itself off.

120
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,880
Connection drops after the first command.

121
00:05:55,883 --> 00:05:58,050
Which coincidentally, was to tell it

122
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,890
to go to the different partition to flash something.

123
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:03,630
I don't really know what it was.

124
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:07,410
I just know that it told it to flash to the different side

125
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,180
and then that's the end of the story.

126
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:11,930
And ever since then, I've not been able to boot this phone.

127
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:14,310
So I decided, okay, let's drain the battery,

128
00:06:14,316 --> 00:06:17,460
do the standard procedure that everyone tells you on Reddit.

129
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:20,910
Drain the battery and then plug it, charge it back up, whatever.

130
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:21,890
I've did everything.

131
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:25,110
Nothing brings it back up anymore.

132
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:28,610
Now there are some heat created by the power management IC,

133
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:30,180
but that's all there is to it.

134
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,330
No other parts of the phone started heating up

135
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,860
or anything during charging.

136
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:36,660
I thought to myself, that's pretty much the end of it, isn't it?

137
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,760
Like I got no phone anymore.

138
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:41,410
So I ended up daily driving this iPhone 6 again.

139
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:45,800
Which is kind of a grim story if you tell me.

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,760
Man, Razer, why are you such a disappointing company?

141
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:52,210
Now Razer, if you have not been updating security updates

142
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:55,880
for your Razer Phone 2, I'll be deeply disappointed in you.

143
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:59,350
In fact, if you're not going to make a Razer Phone 3, so be it.

144
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,930
We don't want to see you anymore in the phone space.

145
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:06,800
Because it was getting really close to being a Treble-perfect phone.

146
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,510
Like an alternative to Pixels.

147
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:11,960
But they screwed up everything with the quality control of the phone.

148
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:17,910
Everything is just lackluster and filled with unanswered questions

149
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,810
by the community to the Razer support.

150
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:24,810
Like if you go up to Razer Phone on the subreddit,

151
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:26,760
you see a whole lot of people facing issues

152
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:30,530
and have not had so much success with the customer support.

153
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,080
If anything, the closest they can do is just RMA it

154
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,430
and that's all there is to it.

155
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:38,230
So this is my personal terrible experience with the Razer Phone.

156
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:41,980
And this is what led to me holding on to a dead relic.

157
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:43,880
I've actually torn down this phone before.

158
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:46,810
So you can see that the speaker grills are gone.

159
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,060
Which is not really a grill

160
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,010
as you can see now that we've taken it off.

161
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:51,730
Like the speakers right here.

162
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:53,480
And then there's another down here.

163
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:54,100
That's it.

164
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,260
Whatever is over here is completely jack shit nothing.

165
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:58,510
And that's the camera,

166
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:00,750
that's probably the proximity sensor and stuff.

167
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,030
That's it.

168
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,110
That's all there is to it.

169
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:06,060
So I know the Razer Phone 1 was supposed

170
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:09,580
to be like a spiritual successor to the…

171
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,730
What was that dead company phone called?

172
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:15,310
So the Razer Phone was supposed to be a spiritual successor

173
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:16,960
to the Nexbit Robin.

174
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:19,010
I don't know what happened to the Nexbit Robin,

175
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:23,530
but this phone was pretty much one-on-one to the Nexbit Robin,

176
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:26,030
but with more gaming specs onto it.

177
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:29,780
And I gotta be honest, I am really disappointed.

178
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:33,780
This phone could be the simplest gaming phone in the entire world.

179
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:37,730
Well too bad, REDMAGIC has taken over this part of the category.

180
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,250
So, eh.

181
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,950
But yeah, this is the saddest story

182
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,390
I've ever had when it comes to an Android phone.

183
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,850
But that's not the end of the story unfortunately.

184
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,950
So without a mobile phone, I thought,

185
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,790
"okay, how am I gonna communicate with my groupmates in university?"

186
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,390
Well, this iPhone is technically doing the job,

187
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,830
but it's starting to show its age

188
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,510
and I have to bring a battery bank with me pretty much all the goddamn time.

189
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:05,580
Not to mention, in my pocket.

190
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,860
Not in the bag, in my pocket.

191
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:10,290
Because this phone dies so quickly

192
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,560
that it only lasts 30 minutes of its lifetime.

193
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:16,880
So I have to pretty much stay on tether pretty much most of the time.

194
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:19,810
Think of it like the phone is on life support

195
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:23,130
and I have to make sure that I don't end it, I guess.

196
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:29,390
So with pure desperation, and luckily I was on a contract with a telco,

197
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,140
I thought to myself, okay, let's buy a contract phone.

198
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:36,380
For a cheap low low price of 100 yen,

199
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,890
I got myself a Redmi Note 7.

200
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,360
That's right, the Redmi Note 7 is pretty much the cheapest contract phone

201
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:45,410
I've ever picked up.

202
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,480
Though the phone has been pretty decent.

203
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:50,710
There were some continuous security updates,

204
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,380
but it's not that frequent.

205
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,710
But let's be honest, it's always with the Chinese phone manufacturers

206
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:58,380
that always never promises on updates.

207
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:03,760
So I can't really expect much, but they have gone through a major update,

208
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:06,830
which was long enough for me to pick up a phone.

209
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,630
Or a phone.

210
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:12,080
So I picked up the Samsung Galaxy S10.

211
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,350
Unfortunately, the S10 is not with me anymore,

212
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,890
because you will not believe this story,

213
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,830
which is kind of crazy in my opinion.

214
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,280
So what happened is my mom dropped her* phone,

215
00:10:21,283 --> 00:10:25,260
which was a Galaxy S8, and it shattered the touchscreen.

216
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:28,530
Like not just the glass, all the way down to the digitizer.

217
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,250
Complete shattered.

218
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,510
And it was unusable.

219
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:35,540
And she thought to herself, "oh god, I should probably get a new phone."

220
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:38,380
And then I told her, "you know what, fine,

221
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:41,810
I'll just sell my phone to you, and then I'll get a brand new one."

222
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:45,980
And that's how the Galaxy Note 10 Plus that you've been seeing

223
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:49,660
in the previous videos all these times, came to be.

224
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:54,180
So this is my goofy ass experience with Android phones.

225
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:59,540
It was such a crazy anarchy, that it made me jump back to iPhones.

226
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:02,060
Not because of these bad experiences,

227
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:06,600
but the anarchy of business that happens in the business world.

228
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,530
It's kind of more to favor the business people, than to favor the user.

229
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:15,860
So if I can't run with a phone for more than 4 years,

230
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:19,700
without it running into serious, fatal problems every time,

231
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,850
why should I be trusting a certain company for that?

232
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,410
So I've kind of lost my mind, and I went for an iPhone 12 Pro Max.

233
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,910
But I don't regret getting an iPhone 12 Pro Max.

234
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,130
I'm there for the performance, not the wall garden.

235
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:36,950
I've said multiple times on the Alternative Apps video in iOS,

236
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:41,080
that I use phones mainly for the performance and longevity.

237
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,410
And I couldn't care less about the ecosystem.

238
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,700
The ecosystem has nothing to do with me at the moment,

239
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,100
because I don't really care too much about customizability,

240
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,010
and sideloading is kind of a side thing to me, honestly.

241
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:56,040
It doesn't really affect me as much.

242
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,710
So there you have it.

243
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,660
This is another crazy story,

244
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:03,890
and I hope this doesn't come off as an anti-Android, pro-Apple

245
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,960
kind of looking ass video.

246
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:07,760
I am not siding with any side.

247
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:10,430
I still think Android has a lot of potential,

248
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:15,480
and Google is still making some teeny tiny strides on making it better.

249
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:17,830
But they also have a lot of L's,

250
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,380
especially from, as of the time of filming,

251
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:24,350
Google Play started rolling out a new, I wouldn't call it an API,

252
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,360
but a flag that allows developers to prohibit people from sideloading

253
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:31,000
a certain app of their making.

254
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,200
But I don't think that's too big of an issue.

255
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,890
I think this is more of a security concern for, say, bank apps

256
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:37,810
and stuff like that.

257
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:41,880
But the fact that Google did not address it specifically for bank apps,

258
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:44,710
kind of goes to show that they couldn't really care less

259
00:12:44,716 --> 00:12:47,260
about the freedom of Android users.

260
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,100
But I got my fair share to burn on Apple.

261
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,110
But with all the ecosystem thingy out of the way,

262
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:54,480
I honestly don't have much opinion about it.

263
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:57,780
Because I've been using this iPhone 12 for four years now.

264
00:12:57,783 --> 00:13:02,380
I mean, just a few weeks it will be four years old from the time of filming.

265
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,410
And the battery still kind of stands.

266
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,980
And considering how consistent Apple has been

267
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,380
with their software updates with their phones,

268
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:12,710
I would like to service the battery and keep going with it.

269
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:14,630
Especially when I'm at this time

270
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:17,230
where I actually cannot afford any other phones.

271
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,210
I seriously don't have any money.

272
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,790
And I'm still trying to grasp onto dear life.

273
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,750
Trying to make the best out of the content

274
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,410
and best out of my life for you,

275
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:29,010
for everyone who's watching this video in these tough times.

276
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,630
But yeah, anyways, with that said,

277
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,600
thank you so much for chilling with me.

279
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:36,410
Be sure to share me around in all your socials

280
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,890
if you do kind of enjoy me.

281
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:40,500
And suggest more content, I guess.

282
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,330
What kind of content do you want to watch out of me?

283
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,710
And I don't know.

284
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:46,290
If you want to hear more story times out of me,

285
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:48,110
let me know in the comments below.

286
00:13:48,116 --> 00:13:52,450
And with that said, I hope you like this anarchy of an Android story.

287
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,660
And I'll see you guys next time.

288
