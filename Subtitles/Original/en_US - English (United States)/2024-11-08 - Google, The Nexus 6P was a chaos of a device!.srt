1
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:07,280
Oh, you know we're going to be talking about a very ancient phone.

2
00:00:07,283 --> 00:00:08,150
Kon-Melo!

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,300
It's ya Tech Wizardess girl, MeloriTensei.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,280
Once again, we're at a very, very old phone this time.

5
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:17,610
This time around, it's ye olde classic Google Nexus 6P.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,610
Really?

7
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:24,630
Now if you're wondering why I'm constantly getting

8
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:28,510
this tethered right now and constantly connected to power,

9
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:30,880
that's because this phone's battery is more or less

10
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:31,960
very, very dead.

11
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,030
But we'll get into the story of that in a moment.

12
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:36,410
But here's something a little different about this phone.

13
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,290
The touchscreen is barely working

14
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:41,280
and the screen is kind of coming off.

15
00:00:41,283 --> 00:00:42,880
But I'm not going to bother repairing this.

16
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:44,390
This is really, really old now.

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,880
So currently the ROM it's currently having is LineageOS.

18
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:51,780
There really isn't much because I don't really use this phone anymore.

19
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:53,830
So I was using it for some experiments,

20
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,560
but the battery died too quickly.

21
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:59,210
So I kind of bailed out on this whole thing.

22
00:00:59,216 --> 00:01:02,930
So what's the story behind me getting a Nexus 6P?

23
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:04,510
Well the story was pretty simple.

24
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:06,000
So I was on the iPhone 6

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,700
and I wanted to try out the Android space because when I was having

26
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,210
an iPhone and I thought to myself,

27
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:14,430
okay, maybe I should probably give Android a try.

28
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,960
So this is set before the Razer phone, by the way.

29
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:21,660
So you're hearing a prequel of the previous video.

30
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:26,080
So I live in a world where it's kind of predominantly Android.

31
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:29,960
So of course comes with a very, very weird

32
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:33,780
social toxicity of people going against iPhone users

33
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:36,680
saying that iPhone users are elitist and stuff.

34
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:39,610
I didn't quite like that because I don't really see myself as one.

35
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:42,880
I'm just an average middle-class person

36
00:01:42,883 --> 00:01:46,230
that just chose iPhone because they just worked out for me.

37
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:49,080
And they're not all that expensive because at that time,

38
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,930
Android phones were just as expensive

39
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,400
so it's a matter of choice most of the time.

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,310
So I thought to myself, okay, maybe I should probably

41
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:58,260
give Android a try and maybe discover everything that I have

42
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,210
already discovered prior on iOS.

43
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:02,840
So like I've discovered jailbreaking on iOS

44
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:04,980
and discovered Cydia and repos

45
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:07,790
and a whole lot of different stuff that were on jailbreaking

46
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,530
and figured out how I can customize my phone that way

47
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:12,880
and stuff like that.

48
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,830
So why not I try doing, well, not exactly the same,

49
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,300
but do a lot of discoveries on the Android

50
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,860
and put the same amount of efforts of discovery

51
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:24,310
onto the Android space.

52
00:02:24,316 --> 00:02:28,110
And this is the phone I started with, the Google Nexus 6P.

53
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:31,060
Well, the reason why I went for the Nexus 6P

54
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,730
was because a lot of YouTubers were using it at a time

55
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,880
when the world was really predominantly Android.

56
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:41,310
Where like say someone going on the lines of Lew from Unbox Therapy

57
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:47,630
and if I'm not mistaken, maybe even Linus Tech Tips was also using the 6P.
(I was dead wrong, he reviewed the Nexus 6, not 6P)

58
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:50,690
So I thought, okay, it's coming from Google, right?

59
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,610
So let's give it a try because

60
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:55,980
surely Google would provide the cleanest Android experience

61
00:02:55,983 --> 00:03:01,010
that is kind of to their vision of what's a stock Android, I guess.

62
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:03,760
So I went with it and it was pretty good.

63
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:08,130
The phone was pretty, well, serviceable is a way just to put it

64
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:12,030
because the processor it has was, well, a little,

65
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:14,560
hmm, leaves a lot to be desired.
(Possibly due to the background processes chugging the entire experience)

66
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:17,830
I was playing Honkai Impact, but the frame rates were kind of bad.

67
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,840
It was like 20-ish frames at a time, even on the lowest settings.

68
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:28,030
It was, well, I could do passive grinds with it, but not enough to do major story grinds.

69
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:31,010
So I kind of went back to the iPhone for those games.

70
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:31,680
That's fine.

71
00:03:31,683 --> 00:03:35,060
That's perfectly fine because security updates were consistent,

72
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,110
bank apps work as expected,

73
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,750
and pictures, I wouldn't say they're amazing,

74
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,910
but they were great for their time.

75
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,430
And there were just a whole lot of things that went right

76
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:48,630
with the Nexus 6P until the hardware strikes.

77
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:52,030
So if you didn't understand, you might want to do a little bit of research

78
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:56,510
about the lawsuit that hit Huawei, which is the manufacturer of the phone,

79
00:03:56,516 --> 00:04:02,660
and Google over the premature degration of the battery on all Nexus 6P devices.

80
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,510
You might want to read up on the whole story about it

81
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:05,630
and the whole timeline a little bit,

82
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:09,510
but here's how I shorten it in my perspective as a user.

83
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:13,510
The battery died sooner than I thought, particularly within a year and a half.

84
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:18,960
And the way it died is the same as how a four-year-old iPhone would,

85
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:22,710
which is that the battery health has gone down to like probably 60-ish percent,

86
00:04:22,716 --> 00:04:23,800
50-ish percent,

87
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,080
but this one had a more serious case of death.

88
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,660
It died prematurely as I just used it,

89
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,810
and then the screen just blacked out.

90
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:31,390
Boop.

91
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,130
And then when you try to power it on,

92
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,360
it suddenly shows 50-ish percent battery,

93
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:36,980
and then it dies in another minute.

94
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:39,630
And then I turn it back on, 20 percent, boop, dies again.

95
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:42,350
Turn it back on, 10 percent, 5, gone.

96
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,440
What is going on?

97
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,110
I did not understand what was going on.

98
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,760
For all I know, I figured it would be another battery death.

99
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:50,250
It's probably just poor battery quality, I guess.

100
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,680
So I took it to a nearby service center, an official service center.

101
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:57,710
I don't quite remember if it was Huawei or Google,

102
00:04:57,716 --> 00:05:00,850
but I did go to a service center for either of them,

103
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,130
and I didn't like what they told me.

104
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:06,210
They told me it was a motherboard issue,

105
00:05:06,216 --> 00:05:09,110
and that the motherboard's power IC is having issues

106
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:10,690
detecting the battery properly.

107
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:17,280
And they charged me $300 for the replacement of the said motherboard.

108
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,460
$300!

109
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:19,110
No!

110
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:23,360
I don't pay $600 just to get that kind of experience.

111
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,750
So I told them no, took my device back,

112
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,830
and it's been like this, this way.

113
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,500
It has never been swapped, nothing has been swapped,

114
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,930
the battery has really not changed at all.

115
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,680
And today, I wouldn't say today, but more like recently, these days,

116
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:42,660
as you can see, judging by the screen behaving like that,

117
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,430
yeah, um, the battery bloated finally.

118
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:48,160
Or more like it bloated enough to pop the screen off.

119
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,180
And you may think,

120
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,610
Mel, you're charging a bloated device, stop doing that!

121
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:53,880
Yes, I get you, I get you.

122
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:56,010
This will be the last time that I'll be doing that.

123
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:58,010
I'm doing that because I wanted to show you

124
00:05:58,016 --> 00:06:01,110
what was on the screen for its very last life,

125
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:03,660
before I give it a quiet down moment, I guess.

126
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,560
So let's demonstrate how quickly it dies.

127
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,940
But first, we have to head down to the settings,

128
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:11,310
and we're gonna get into display,

129
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:13,980
and set screen time out to 30 minutes.

130
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:17,080
Right, let's have a moment, let's sit down,

131
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,000
and see how quickly it dies, I guess.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,310
You guys ready?

133
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:22,000
Boop!

134
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,230
The cable's off.

135
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,110
Now let's see how quickly it dies,

136
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:27,230
just by standing by on this screen.

137
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,850
So while we wait, I'm gonna talk about how I was feeling

138
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,180
when I bought this phone in the first place.

139
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,660
So, I thought to myself, it's kind of a cool concept

140
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:39,280
because I've already touched Androids for like, quite a long time now,

141
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:41,480
this is not my first Android phone, honestly.

142
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:44,550
If anything, it's my first modern Android phone,

143
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,810
because I have historically touched older phones,

144
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:50,410
and to those OGs who are in the millennial era,

145
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,600
I know you feel me, because

146
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,380
what if I tell you that my first Android phone was a Sony Xperia X10 Mini.

147
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:03,510
That's right, it's that Android 2 phone, that one Jelly Bean phone.
(*Not Jelly Bean, it's Eclair)

148
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:05,810
That was my first Android phone.

149
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:09,390
In fact, I had this phone before I had my first iPhone,

150
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,010
which was the iPhone 4S.

151
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:16,180
So technically, I am not really, "have not tried Android", ever.

152
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:17,940
I have used Android prior,

153
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:22,210
and I just simply don't give a shit about the operating systems.

154
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:23,800
What I really care about is

155
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,310
how companies maintain the operating systems.

156
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:31,440
But with that aside, my modern Android experience has been kind of pleasant

157
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:33,660
because I have sideloaded some applications,

158
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:37,100
but it's mostly just small little cosmetic things that,

159
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,180
because for someone who formats phones quite often,

160
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:44,410
because I'm the kind of person who's like,

161
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,140
throws a lot of junk on the Files app,

162
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:49,800
and then at some point we just thought to ourselves,

163
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,630
why the hell did we run out of space?

164
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:56,250
And usually I just have this tendency to just get lazy

165
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,410
and purge everything.

166
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,180
Well, at least that's what the past me does.

167
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:03,230
But now, nowadays, I kind of just try to reduce the amount of clutter

168
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,480
and try to keep an eye on my storage usage

169
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:09,850
and actually take these files out, like say my photos and stuff,

170
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,890
take it out when it has been sitting there for a very long time.

171
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,510
So if anything's lost, it's not really lost.

172
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:16,800
You know, you get what I mean.

173
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,830
Just preserving the data, I guess.

174
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,230
But in the past, I was pretty much a data destroyer.

175
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:25,480
Because get this, Honkai Impact takes a lot of space.

176
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:27,880
Because if you pre-cache or pre-download

177
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,610
all the assets that the game has,

178
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:31,830
it's going to start bulking up.

179
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,040
Like even right now, you could probably bulk it up

180
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:38,280
to like probably some 30, 40 gigs for just the whole game

181
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:39,180
top to bottom.

182
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:42,950
So, but fortunate for me, at that time I only played, well,

183
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,460
a small handful of games, I guess.

184
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:49,230
Namely, Love Live! School Idol Festival 1 and Honkai Impact.

185
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:51,890
And I think that's pretty much the only games I played.

186
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,280
I did not really pick up Azur Lane until I had the Razer Phone.

187
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:58,580
But yeah, I'm not really a gamer personally.

188
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:02,390
But yeah, I mean, LittleMel wasn't really a gamer at all.

189
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,230
She just wants a game that she can just play along, chill,

190
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,450
and not think at all.

191
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,880
But yeah, I honestly think this is a pretty cool device

192
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,410
because, look at this.

193
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,130
This, this, these two are speakers.

194
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:16,880
And if you play them on stereo, they sound seriously amazing.

195
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:19,060
Like, you don't even need Dolby Atmos.

196
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:22,360
They sound just wonderful on the default tune.

197
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:24,850
But things just did not feel right sometimes.

198
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,060
Although this phone is pretty customizable,

199
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,350
you can have AOSPs on it because a lot of ROMs support it

200
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,430
because it was the easiest to support because it's coming from Google.

201
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:36,790
I just feel like something felt really, really missing

202
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,410
in the heart of the Nexus 6P.

203
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,410
And that's when the Google Pixels came out.

204
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,980
Unfortunately, I did not get my hands on a Pixel.

205
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,360
So yeah, I kind of missed the opportunity.

206
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:49,780
The reason why I had the Samsung Galaxy S10 or the Note 10 today

207
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:53,910
is because at the time, Google Pixels were not shipped to where I'm at.

208
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,560
So, Pixels were not available and I could not get a Pixel.

209
00:09:57,566 --> 00:10:00,080
I really, really would have picked up a Pixel.

210
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,210
But unfortunately, as luck struck, it did not come.

211
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:05,790
So the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 was kind of like

212
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,060
the next best choice, if anything.

213
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,500
Because there was no flagship on Nokia yet.

214
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,330
I really want to try out Nokia because of their, their Android,

215
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:14,880
what was it?

216
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:15,860
Android certified?

217
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,130
Android One program?

218
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:19,510
Which is one of the coolest ideas I've ever seen in my life.

219
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:22,380
Unfortunately again, they don't have flagships.

220
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:23,930
They got mid-range phones only.

221
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,640
And my budget was for flagships, unfortunately.

222
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:31,060
So the only flagship I could think of was simply the Samsung Galaxy S10,

223
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:32,130
I mean Note 10+.

224
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,010
So, meh.

225
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:35,930
But regardless, you could tell me to pick up a gaming phone

226
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:39,880
like the ASUS ROG phone or the Red Magic.

227
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:44,230
But I have a hard time trusting them when it comes to update consistency.

228
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,760
But if you think their updates are consistent,

229
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:50,510
like say at least quarterly, please let me know in the comments below.

230
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,880
And let me know of your experience.

231
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:52,410
Is it good?

232
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:52,930
Is it bad?

233
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:53,700
Please let me know.

234
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,130
Because that's probably the only barrier for me

235
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,180
from ever choosing those phones.

236
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:02,430
So that's kind of what matters to me at the moment.

237
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:04,950
However, the second nature that mattered to me

238
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,860
is whether you can install AOSPs on it.

239
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:11,610
Because recently, some companies started restricting

240
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:15,680
unlocking the bootloader for quote-unquote security reasons.

241
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:19,060
And I don't quite appreciate that behavior.

242
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:21,350
Like what security reasons?

243
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,610
If you're going to open the bootloader,

244
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,930
there is a flag that checks for bootloader enablement.

245
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:29,790
So, why are companies going out of their way,

246
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,280
blocking the unlocking of bootloader?

247
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:33,700
I don't quite understand.

248
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,130
Somebody should explain that to me.

249
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,430
Be it on the Discord server or in the comments.

250
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:38,830
Damn, it's been 4 minutes.

251
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,410
It lasted pretty well, didn't it?

252
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:44,030
A moment of silence for the Nexus 6P.

253
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:47,980
Alright, where was I?

254
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:53,610
So, after the whole Nexus 6P lawsuit and drama and everything,

255
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:57,100
I kind of thought, nope, we're going to the other side of the extremes.

256
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,640
So we got the spectrum of purity, I guess.

257
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:03,830
On this side, we got pure, complete purity.

258
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:07,350
And then on the other side, we got gimmicks or filled with features.

259
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:13,930
So where I'll put Nexus 6P would be somewhere around this part of the spectrum.

260
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,760
Like around where this line is, this metal line is.

261
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:21,390
And then where the Razer phone is, well, it's at the tip.

262
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:22,950
Dead on the tip.

263
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,910
Like, there's no different way to explain it.

264
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:26,980
It's dead on the tip.

265
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:31,000
And then I believe Samsung would be somewhere around this part of the spectrum.

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,290
Where it's like, it has some bit of purity, but it's not pure in visuals.

267
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:39,330
So it is still a lot of gimmick.

268
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:44,030
Like, say, the terrible launcher known as TouchWiz.

269
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,760
And also the edge display,

270
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:49,960
which has now been converted into some form of like sidebar.

271
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:52,680
Man, the edge screen felt dead, I guess.

272
00:12:52,683 --> 00:12:56,460
I kind of appreciate the ruler feature on the edge screen.

273
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:57,630
I really, really like that.

274
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:00,810
And I'm glad they brought it over to the modern day edge screen.

275
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:02,450
So props to you, Samsung, I guess.

276
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,460
The ruler was very, very useful.

277
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:07,010
Useful enough for me to need to measure anything

278
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:10,030
without needing to bring a separate ruler or a tape measurement.

279
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:10,860
It was pretty handy.

280
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:13,200
But yeah, back to the Nexus 6P.

281
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,930
So what did I do with the Nexus 6P anyway?

282
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:19,510
Aside from installing AOSP, I discovered something that really jumped out to me.

283
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:21,660
That was really out there.

284
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,360
Complete world's difference level out there.

285
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:27,040
And I would like to make a video out of it.

286
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:28,200
Do you want to know what it is?

287
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,110
Somebody at UBports thought it's a really cool idea

288
00:13:32,116 --> 00:13:35,230
to port Ubuntu into Android phones.

289
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:41,510
And the way Ubuntu behaves on phones are, well, visually very different.

290
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:43,130
I would like to discover into that.

291
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:45,780
Unfortunately, I don't have phones that currently supports

292
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,980
the latest version of Ubuntu Touch.
(This is the message when viewing devices that are supported in the deprecated 16.04)

293
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:51,750
So I'll be bringing in the phone that is mostly supported,
(You are viewing data for an obsolete Ubuntu Touch release)

294
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,830
but on a deprecated version.
(that is kept for historical reasons, please use the latest stable release instead.)

295
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,430
But regardless, I hope this is worth a video to make.

296
00:13:56,433 --> 00:14:02,630
And yeah, and this is the story to how I came to have the Nexus 6P.

297
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,880
And also surprisingly, it's still alive for some minutes.

298
00:14:06,883 --> 00:14:11,330
Well maybe it's because I've not really done anything online, I guess.

299
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,710
What if say I connect to Wi-Fi right now?

300
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:15,830
Okay, we're connected to Wi-Fi now.

301
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,580
And where's the browser?

302
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:18,660
Oh my god.

303
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,010
Wait a second.

304
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:21,360
Where's the browser?

305
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:23,560
Wait, there's no browser in this AOSP?

306
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:24,610
What the heck?

307
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:26,430
Well, that was the first time for me.

308
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:29,460
Okay, I guess we're not surfing the internet then.

309
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:30,860
There's nothing in the gallery.

310
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:31,890
Damn.

311
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:33,080
I barely use this phone.

312
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,140
That's surprising.

313
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:35,710
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Google.

314
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:38,210
There, this is one of the articles that I'm talking about.

315
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:41,830
So please have a good read at it so you understand what's going on

316
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,830
in the world of Nexus 6P users.

317
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,100
And also this Reddit thread, I guess.

318
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,330
These two are a good read.

319
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:53,010
And it's a whole messy situation revolving around the Nexus 6P.

320
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:55,310
But yeah, with that said, thank you so much for watching.

321
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:57,380
Be sure to subscribe, be sure to press the notification bell

322
00:14:57,383 --> 00:15:00,230
if you want to hear more story times out of me about Android,

323
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,810
phones, tech, anything.

324
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:02,610
Please let me know.

325
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:06,980
I have plenty of historical tech in my hands that I can make videos about.

326
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:10,330
And if you're excited to hear more, please let me know.

327
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,640
I will look forward to making more.

328
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:14,830
And this should be one of the few last videos

329
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,790
before I make another big project video, I guess.

330
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,750
And with that said, thank you so much for watching.

331
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,930
See you guys next time.

332
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,560
OtsuMelo deshita.

333
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,960
Weee.

334
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,280
Bleh.
