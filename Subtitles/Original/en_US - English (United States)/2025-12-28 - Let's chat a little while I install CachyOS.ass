Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.13,0:00:08.87,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Hello, hello.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.87,0:00:11.63,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,It's been quite a while since I last filmed something
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.63,0:00:13.85,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,that is run and gun, very, very short.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.85,0:00:15.98,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Well, think of this as a little vlog.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.98,0:00:19.32,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So you see right here, we have the old laptop
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.32,0:00:22.45,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,that we used to use in the Ventoy video
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.45,0:00:24.72,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,that we recorded some time ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.72,0:00:27.67,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,And I realized ever since then,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.67,0:00:29.52,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I haven't really properly used it
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.52,0:00:31.35,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,ever since I got the Steam Deck.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.35,0:00:36.98,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So I want to make this laptop a permanent setup in my bedroom.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.98,0:00:39.27,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So I at least have some form of computer
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.27,0:00:41.37,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,that runs faster than the Steam Deck
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.37,0:00:43.48,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,or something that I want to mess around with.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.48,0:00:46.13,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Like say, maybe anything on Linux side
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.13,0:00:50.02,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,to try test things out like postmarketOS or something like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.02,0:00:53.05,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, by the way, keep an eye on the channel
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.05,0:00:55.42,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,because there will be something for postmarketOS.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.42,0:00:59.88,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,And I figured I've not really been posting videos lately
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.88,0:01:03.47,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and my channel has kind of fallen off in the face of the algorithm.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.47,0:01:06.15,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So I thought, let's make something quick and run and gun.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.15,0:01:08.67,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So, let's catch up with each other.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.67,0:01:11.38,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Put in the comments below, what are you doing?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.38,0:01:13.23,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,What have you been up to lately?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.23,0:01:14.85,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Just let me know in the comments below
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.85,0:01:17.80,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and maybe we'll have a little... sweet little talk.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.80,0:01:21.12,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Meanwhile, we're going to install CachyOS on this thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.12,0:01:25.85,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So previously, this had Windows 10 IoT LTSC
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.85,0:01:30.27,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and I was testing around specifically Apex Legends
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.27,0:01:34.72,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,on whether that game runs after Windows 10 has been discontinued.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.72,0:01:38.78,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So I thought, well, I kind of miss Linux a little bit on this laptop
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.78,0:01:41.68,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,because this laptop used to dual boot a lot.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.68,0:01:43.42,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So I thought, let's bring that back.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.42,0:01:44.63,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Let's dual boot a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.63,0:01:48.43,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Though I'm not really going to show the dual booting process.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.43,0:01:51.83,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Instead, I'm just going to show you installing CachyOS on its own
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.83,0:01:55.73,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,because I'm not sure what Windows is going to do to this laptop
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.68,0:01:59.68,Music,,0,0,0,,♫Lunna Groove - Night Breeze♫
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.73,0:02:00.18,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and possibly elongate the whole filming process.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.18,0:02:03.35,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Especially when I said I'm going to make a quick short video.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.35,0:02:05.23,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So... you get the gist.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.23,0:02:07.30,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I will be working on it off camera.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.30,0:02:10.10,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe there might be an update video at some point.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.10,0:02:13.75,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,But yeah, so the final result of this laptop is going to be,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.75,0:02:16.62,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,we're going to have CachyOS on this video
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.62,0:02:20.38,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and then off camera, there will also be a dual boot of Windows 10.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.38,0:02:23.00,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So with that in mind, let's get right into it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.00,0:02:26.02,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So before we get started, umm...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.02,0:02:29.00,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,obviously, if you haven't checked out my Ventoy video,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.00,0:02:30.87,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,it would be awesome if you do.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.87,0:02:34.10,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,However, we're going to be using the same USB drive
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.10,0:02:37.00,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,that we have previously used on the Ventoy video.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.00,0:02:38.58,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe not exactly the same.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.58,0:02:40.00,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I just needed more space.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.00,0:02:42.93,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So I kind of ran out of space.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.33,0:02:42.93,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,{\ytshake\pos(1308,748)}Hehe...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.93,0:02:46.53,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,With that USB plugged in, let's go into the BIOS.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.53,0:02:48.23,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I'm going to spam the delete button.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.22,0:02:53.60,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I didn't realize that this laptop doesn't boot into BIOS\Nusing Del key but ye olde F2 key instead.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.23,0:02:50.10,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, feck, it went to Windows.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.10,0:02:52.18,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,{\ytshake\pos(1308,748)}He he ha ha ha.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.18,0:02:53.95,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Curse you!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.95,0:02:57.23,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,All right, we're shutting down once more.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.23,0:02:59.12,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,There we go.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.12,0:03:02.62,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Now let's go back to the BIOS for real.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.62,0:03:05.53,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,And we ended up in Windows again.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.53,0:03:07.92,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Are you fucking serious?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.92,0:03:09.30,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Fuck's sake!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.30,0:03:10.82,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Windows, why?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.82,0:03:11.67,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,That's it, laptop.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.67,0:03:14.28,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I have fucking enough with you.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.28,0:03:17.08,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Recovery... Advanced Startup...

Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.53,0:03:30.08,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Restart to Firmware.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.85,0:03:32.22,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,{\ytshake\pos(1308,748)}Hehe
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.95,0:03:32.77,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Finally got into the BIOS
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.08,0:03:32.88,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,{\an8}Fucking finally.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.88,0:03:36.23,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Now, you may not be able to see it in the capture card, but
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.23,0:03:40.78,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,from here, there is the usual BIOS screen and...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.78,0:03:45.33,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and I can just press F8 for boot menu and I boot from the USB.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.33,0:03:50.58,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, unfortunately, it doesn't mirror displays when I'm on Ventoy.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.58,0:03:52.73,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Well, that's kind of unfortunate.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.73,0:03:55.72,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Okay, just picture it in your mind:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.72,0:04:01.22,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,that I'm going to Linux folder... Arch... and CachyOS.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.22,0:04:04.42,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Then we go to boot in normal mode
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.42,0:04:09.07,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and there should be CachyOS in their GRUB menu
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.07,0:04:11.53,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and CachyOS should be booting now.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.53,0:04:13.82,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,And by then, we should…
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.82,0:04:15.88,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Oopies....
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.15,0:04:21.03,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Well, that doesn't seem too good now, is it?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.03,0:04:21.78,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Now, no worries.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.78,0:04:24.97,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,This is pretty common with things like my laptop specifically.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.83,0:04:25.83,Music,,0,0,0,,♫Sarii - あまのがわ♫
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.97,0:04:28.83,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So... so what you got to do is… umm...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.83,0:04:31.40,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Oopies, the USB gone missing.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.40,0:04:33.22,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Hey, it shows up finally.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.22,0:04:37.77,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,We're going to Ventoy, Linux, Arch, CachyOS,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.77,0:04:39.43,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,but instead of booting in normal mode,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.43,0:04:41.18,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,we're going to boot in GRUB2 mode
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.18,0:04:43.27,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,because for interesting reasons,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.27,0:04:46.02,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,normal mode in Ventoy doesn't work too well
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.02,0:04:50.37,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,on this specific hardware, or at least in my laptop's specific case.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.37,0:04:54.72,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So in theory, when I boot in GRUB2 mode,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.72,0:04:57.02,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,we should be able to boot into CachyOS.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.02,0:04:58.18,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,From what I'm seeing right now,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.18,0:05:01.33,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,it's currently copying rootfs image to RAM.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.33,0:05:02.18,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,That's cool.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.18,0:05:06.23,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Now we just have to wait for it to cache the whole installer into RAM.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.23,0:05:07.73,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Well, this is taking a while.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.73,0:05:10.85,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Welp, more tea for me.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.67,0:05:16.93,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Now we just wait for it to boot,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.93,0:05:21.92,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,and we should be able to have a display once we get there.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.92,0:05:26.13,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,"A start job is running for rebuild dynamic link of cache."
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.13,0:05:28.25,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I don't think I understand any of it.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.88,0:05:33.80,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Give me display on the capture card.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.80,0:05:36.20,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,It is enabled but not mirroring.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.20,0:05:37.33,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Okay, cool.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.33,0:05:38.52,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, there we go.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.52,0:05:41.78,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,We finally got Elgato to fucking behave.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.78,0:05:42.90,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,That took a while.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.90,0:05:44.47,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Ayyy, there we go.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.47,0:05:46.43,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,Alright, we're in CachyOS now.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.43,0:05:48.43,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,So I'm kinda new here,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.43,0:05:53.45,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,so I figured this would be the installer, as it literally says.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.40,0:06:02.47,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,But can I at least update after that?

Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.82,0:06:12.07,Mel Default,,0,0,0,,I could just go to the documentations here.
