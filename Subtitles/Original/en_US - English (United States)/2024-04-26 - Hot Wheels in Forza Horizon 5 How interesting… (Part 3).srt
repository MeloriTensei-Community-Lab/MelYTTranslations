1
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:07,660
Ayyyy, it's Gamer Socks!

2
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:11,840
It's not like I like to hear your orders or anything.

3
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:12,550
Hmph.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:15,360
Too far.

6
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:17,060
I don't accept that.

7
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:19,010
No!

8
00:00:19,016 --> 00:00:20,980
Oh my god, I couldn't see in front of me.

9
00:00:20,983 --> 00:00:22,780
Get out of the waaaaay!

10
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:23,660
Sorry!

11
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,050
I'm not listening!

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,160
Wait, what the?

13
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,130
Wait, what?

14
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:30,160
What's going on with the bots?

15
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:38,010
Oh, we got wheelspin.

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,761
What are we getting?

17
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:46,250
Ayyyy, it's Gamer Socks!

18
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,060
We'll drive this car straight to the site.

19
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:55,364
ANA: In 100 meters, turn right.

20
00:00:55,364 --> 00:00:58,630
Okay, I was a little too far off already.

21
00:00:58,633 --> 00:01:00,140
We're driving a Batmobile.

22
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,040
Or so I thought.

23
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,540
It's not a Batmobile.

24
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,530
Let's take shortcuts.

25
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,230
Wee!

26
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:07,910
Ah!

27
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,260
In 200 meters, turn right.

28
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:12,460
Wah!

29
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:14,110
No.

30
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,880
We're going- we're taking it Horizon style.

31
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:20,880
Ah!

32
00:01:20,883 --> 00:01:22,980
Sorry!

33
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,610
I find it hilarious that- ah!

34
00:01:28,383 --> 00:01:30,330
Hello!

35
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,410
Oh, that's a wall!

36
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,010
That's a wall, that's a wall.

37
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:36,830
We gotta find our way in somewhere.

38
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,839
Are we up yet?

39
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:41,450
Yeah, we are up.

40
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,660
Okay, let's go!

41
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:47,930
Nope!

42
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,260
You think I'm actually gonna follow you, Anna?

43
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:56,037
I'm gonna- I'm just building up speed.

44
00:01:56,037 --> 00:02:00,680
It's not like I like to hear your orders or anything.

45
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:02,430
Hmph!

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,910
Ah!

47
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,030
Overshot it.

48
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:10,130
Alright.

49
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:17,630
Damn you, Alberto!

50
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,960
Get out of my way!

51
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

52
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:25,780
too far!

53
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:28,310
Wha- I'm all the way to back right now?

54
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,080
What the hell?

55
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,410
I'm all the way to back just because I missed the turn.

56
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,590
Oh, shit!

57
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,560
"Hit or miss.

58
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:37,810
I guess they never miss, huh?"

59
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:41,160
Oh, that's a dead meme.

60
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:45,930
And I'm not finishing either.

61
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,210
Please, let the pity system work for me!

62
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,190
Ah!

63
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:54,060
Dang it, I only- I only got past one guy.

64
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,830
Let's try out- Let's try out the Hot Wheels event.

65
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,560
See how it's like.

66
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:59,730
See how this is like.

67
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:02,860
Ooh, it's gonna be a long route.

68
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:08,710
The Senna is nostalgic, I gotta be honest.

69
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:14,280
Oh, oh, oh!

70
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:21,810
We could literally have some like drift montage of this guy.

71
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,440
Ah, calming, relaxing race.

72
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:28,910
I mean not race, more like just driving.

73
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,460
Nope.

74
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,860
I don't accept that.

75
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:41,710
No, no.

76
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:46,380
"The extreme driving ahead."

77
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:53,830
So basically it's say- It's simply put, it will be nauseating inducing

78
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,610
if the settings were not auto applied.

79
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,280
Woo!

80
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:06,830
Oh my god, I couldn't see in front of me.

81
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,710
Oh, it's clear as day now.

82
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,930
Here we go.

83
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:15,120
Oh, here we go.

84
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,260
Oh, so that's the roll indicator.

85
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:20,609
I get it now.

86
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:22,960
What happens if I'm in the-

87
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,750
What?

88
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,680
What, the cockpit is a little-

89
00:04:31,816 --> 00:04:33,760
I don't know what I'm feeling about this.

90
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:37,710
It feels weirdly slow

91
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:39,930
from a first person standpoint.

92
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:45,487
But then it looks fast when we get into the far camera.

93
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:48,380
Get out of the way!

94
00:04:48,383 --> 00:04:50,560
Sorry!

95
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,560
Okay, now we're-

96
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:58,000
Ooh!

97
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:02,380
Haley: Watch out for the jump! Stay in the middle!

98
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:04,750
Stay in the middle?

99
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:08,080
Sorry, I'm not listening.

100
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:12,930
Woo!

101
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:15,300
It's the boost.

102
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:20,210
Speaking of Hot Wheels, I used to play Hot Wheels.

103
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:24,750
Like, not the video game, but the cars itself.

104
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,080
Except I don't got the track.

105
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:32,330
Because in where I'm from, tracks weren't sold at all.

106
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:36,180
So, "weren't" as in before.

107
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:37,550
But now they do.

108
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:44,550
So I didn't get to live off of the Hot Wheels childhood.

109
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,940
Ow!

110
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,230
Whoa!

111
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,390
Okay.

112
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,100
Holy frick.

113
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,630
No!

114
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:56,629
Okay, we're good now.

115
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:59,140
Wee!

116
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,810
Woo, beautiful, really.

117
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:05,890
I like the look of this place.

118
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,850
For real.

119
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,280
Ah!

120
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:12,560
Holy!

121
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:14,430
What was that?

122
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:16,050
Ha ha ha!

123
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,410
Holy!

124
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,960
That caught me off guard.

125
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,280
Vamos!

126
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,115
Wee!

127
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:32,690
Shooosh!

128
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,250
That was sick!

129
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,440
That really was sick.

130
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,440
Holy crap.

131
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,640
Chat: "There's no way she's gonna drill a bank account

132
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:45,430
to buy the Ultimate Edition."

133
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:45,960
I did.

134
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:46,860
I literally did.

135
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:49,000
I drilled my bank account.

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,800
"POV, you're the character from the movie Cars made by Disney."

137
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,500
"Can I talk to you about our lord and savior, Lightning McQueen?"

138
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,156
Ha ha ha!

139
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,930
Gura: Hello, ma'am, do you have a minute to talk about

140
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:07,180
our Lord and Savior, Lightning McQueen?

141
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,280
Ooh, rewards.

142
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:10,780
Oh my god, it's a wheel spin.

143
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,140
It's a god dang wheel spin.

144
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:18,760
Oh my god, I can't see!

145
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,580
ANA: You have arrived at your destination.

146
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,460
Wait, I went past it!

147
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:25,330
I went past it!

148
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,810
Hold up, hold up, hold up!

149
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:39,060
So I just have to…

150
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,110
It's a speed trap, isn't it?

151
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:41,030
Yeah, it's a speed trap.

152
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,848
Okay, gotcha.

153
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:45,940
Simple goal.

154
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,750
Don't…

155
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,230
Don't hit any walls.

156
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:51,910
That's the simple goal.

157
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,960
Oy~

158
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:00,960
Ah, I slid off!

159
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,630
Ow...

160
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:07,830
Okay, let's go.

161
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:12,300
Okay, so here's the speed trap.

162
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,330
How much?

163
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:15,930
Two…

164
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:18,060
Aw, two stars.

165
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:21,080
Oh, we're so close!

166
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,140
Okay.

167
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:23,510
Let's try to wrap some cars.

168
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:24,460
Let's go…

169
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:28,292
Let's head off and wrap cars now.

170
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:29,430
Finally.

171
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:30,810
We're home.

172
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:34,480
The first car I want to make it pein [peko].

173
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,060
I want to Itasha it.

174
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:38,350
This, this Supra.

175
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,810
Download and install.

176
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:41,950
It's gonna cost me, like, how much?

177
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,410
Couple 10ks?

178
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,780
I can't afford that yet.

179
00:08:56,783 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay, we'll get into the liveries first.

180
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:05,040
Let's see what anime designs we have.

181
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:06,930
Oh my god.

182
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,750
I know a certain someone that would like this wrap.

183
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,980
Holy, there's a lot of anime design cars.

184
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,360
You know what?

185
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:19,380
I'm gonna make her happy.

186
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:21,410
Because why not?

187
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,160
Let's check out the car horns real quick.

188
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,450
Wedding March?

189
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:31,680
Halo theme.

190
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:32,600
That's not surprising.

191
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,290
Minecraft theme?

192
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:42,580
Oh no.

193
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,730
I was not expecting that at all.

194
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:48,880
What the heck?

195
00:09:48,883 --> 00:09:51,380
That is hilarious!

196
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,360
Oh, no, I didn't mean to-

197
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,480
Why? Is it because I own Forza Horizon 4?

198
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:03,140
That you gave me this?

199
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,930
Wait, I have these on my soundboard as well.

200
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,080
Hold on.

201
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,860
I got this.

202
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:17,760
It's right here.

203
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,660
And this.

204
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,480
Oh, the Windows Tada.

205
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:30,140
That's like the Windows XP or 95 one.

206
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:31,680
Yeah, it is!

207
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:32,560
It is that one.

208
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,510
Oh my god, that's so nostalgic.

209
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,010
Holy crap.

210
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:42,880
So the only novelty horn I actually have is the Royal Fanfare.

211
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:50,360
Just because I own Forza Horizon 4 is it.

212
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:55,208
That's hilarious actually, I gotta be honest.

213
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,310
Let's head on to a normal event again.

214
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:20,460
That was so goddamn distracting!

215
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:21,750
But it's fun too!

216
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,700
Holy shit.

217
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,629
Chat Player: "Why am I using the Bad To The Blood?"

218
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:28,960
Oh!

219
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:31,450
Oh damn, okay.

220
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,950
Wait, what the?

221
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,890
Wait...what...

222
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:42,547
What's going on with the bots?

223
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:45,100
Player Chat: "The game bugged, bro."

224
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:48,880
Okay, we have to restart this event.

225
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,180
Oh, ayo.

226
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,350
Hopefully it's not glitched, you know.

227
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,610
I'm gonna drive it safe.

228
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:01,390
Ow.

229
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:05,510
Play it safe!

230
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,610
No, no, no!

231
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:10,760
I will not resist!

232
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:15,950
I mean, I will resist your temptations of overtaking me!

233
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,600
Shit, I couldn't speak English properly!

234
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:24,630
I couldn't resist the drift in this one.

235
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,980
No, no, Raven, no!

236
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:29,680
No, no, no,

237
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:30,960
no, no, no, no, no, no,

238
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:33,380
no, no, no, no, no, no.

239
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:36,930
CURSE YOU, PERRY THE PLATYPUS!

240
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:41,710
Hahahaha!

241
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:45,540
Thank you.

242
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:47,950
Hahaha!

243
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,560
We can do this, we can do this.

244
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:51,910
No!

245
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,330
Damn it!

246
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:57,100
I'm carrying 100 points at least!

247
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,260
Phew.

248
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:03,250
Tanoshikatta [That was fun]!

249
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,850

254
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,930
I mean, my streams are pretty awesome as well.

255
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,890
