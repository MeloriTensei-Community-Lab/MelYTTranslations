(Emotional music)

2
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,033
We've come a long way.

3
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:19,383
Ever since the start of the channel (201 subs),
where I've began creating videos regularly.

4
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,900
It was tough. (436 subs). But I persevered.

5
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:32,733
One day, miracle struck (706 subs).
And you guys joined in on the ride!

6
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:39,333
You all have been my motivation to keep doing what I love.

7
01:00:42,133 --> 01:00:46,133
This, right here, is you all. Ones who joined, rode
and walked through the journey with me.

8
01:00:48,366 --> 01:00:52,366
I am at a loss for words. All I can say is, thank you.

10
01:00:56,566 --> 01:01:00,566
Thank you all for sharing me around,
chatting with me, supporting me.

11
01:01:04,316 --> 01:01:08,316
Despite the obstables and struggles I've went through behind
the scenes, you 've always stuck with me, looking after me.

12
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:15,166
I hope for better progress in the coming years.
And I hope you'll still come along with me.

13
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:21,266
Have a Happy New Year of 2025.
