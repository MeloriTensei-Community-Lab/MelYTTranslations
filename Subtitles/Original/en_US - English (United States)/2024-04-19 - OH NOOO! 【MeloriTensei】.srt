00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,260
Alejandra: Great, how about a personalized number plate?

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:04,530
Alright, here we go.

3
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:05,260
Hmm.

4
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:07,080
What can I do?

5
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:10,000
Hmmmmmmm.

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:19,250
Should we go for that?

7
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:23,360
Controller disagrees

8
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:24,350
Alejandra: Â¡Ay! no manches. (Ah! No way.)

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,310
Come on, you know I can't let you use that.

10
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, no.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,760
I was not expecting that.

12
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:35,260
Wait, there's a filter!

13
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:43,460
Okay, we can't do YOURMOM apparently.

14
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:47,200
For now, we'll put this as a placeholder.
