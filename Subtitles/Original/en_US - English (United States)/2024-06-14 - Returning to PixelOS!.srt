1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,240
Guess who's back?

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,160
Back again.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,600
That's right, this Android phone's back once more,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,440
for one more extra flash.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,600
If you remember the last 
time I was flashing PixelOS

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,080
and then suddenly I switched to crDroid.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,320
So when I was on crDroid, I was a little 
disappointed in myself at some point,

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,200
because PixelOS was draining batteries 
and I did not bring it up on video.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,640
So when the maintainer of PixelOS and crDroid,

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,800
at least for now,

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,920
spoke about it in the comments 
of that previous Android video,

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,480
check it out, link in the description.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,360
He said that he was working on some stuff

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,040
and needed a whole lot more polishing

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,840
before it goes out to the public.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,280
It was around that week that he 
was just about to roll it out.

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,160
Few days after the video goes out,

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,440
it happened to be the day that 
he wanted to put it out as well.

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,160
So I wanted to try out Android 14 
now, now that I'm done with crDroid,

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,400
because there really isn't much 
for me to mess around in crDroid,

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,280
except for the fact that I do have 
one personal complaint about crDroid.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,040
Maybe it's a LineageOS thing,

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,120
but Dolby Atmos integration on Crdroid 
and LineageOS are a little bit funky

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,440
in a way that when you're up on a certain 
volume meter, it gets stupid loud,

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,880
but then you take it down a step, it 
suddenly becomes really, really soft.

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,080
I don't know if it's something to do 
with software compensations or something,

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,200
but it is something that I didn't really enjoy

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,360
accidentally disturbing the neighbors 
while I'm watching YouTube on the toilet.

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,280
So I want to explore somewhere 
deeper and look around Android 14,

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,680
because currently on this crDroid, 
it's actually just Android 13.

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,200
So I want to take it up a step.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,040
14.

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,840
Let's see what's new in 14.

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,800
Let's experiment with whatever that's 
available for me and just have fun.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,160
"Well, Mel, you said Android 
is a freedom operating system.

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,200
That means you could just root and 
mess around with something, right?"

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,960
Yeah, technically you're not wrong.

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,280
However, I have rooted for a while,

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,680
but it kind of brought me more personal 
inconveniences than conveniences.

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,720
So like, say I want to root 
to solve a certain problem,

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,200
but then comes another problem

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,720
and then I solve this problem 
and then a new problem comes up.

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,600
It just keeps coming on and on and on.

44
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,680
It becomes a little bit impractical 
for my daily use at some point.

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,240
While it does bring a whole lot of conveniences,

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,960
like say using our great sponsor SD Maid SE Pro

47
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,000
to clear up a whole lot of junk deeper 
than what stock Android can get you.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,480
But handling root related stuff like passing 
SafetyNet and solving Dolby Atmos issues

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,240
and even just down to getting 
fonts look just right for you.

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,240
It's starting to become really 
technical that you start to weigh out

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,880
between how much time you spend on 
researching and understanding it

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,240
to is it worth the amount 
of time you spend doing it?

53
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,480
Is it rewarding?

54
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,160
It's basically what I want to say.

55
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
However, it started to become 
less and less rewarding

56
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,960
and it started to become a lot more punishing.

57
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,360
Blame Google for that.

58
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,600
So instead, I'm just going to 
go back to stock clean Android

59
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,520
and we're jumping to Pixel OS instead.

60
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,120
So if you do want instructions 
for how I flashed to PixelOS,

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,840
check out that previous video 
in the description below.

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,440
Because in this video, I'm 
just going through like a vlog.

63
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,480
So as usual, we back everything up and 
we're going to clean up everything here.

64
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,240
You don't really have to clean it up,

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,000
but I like to uninstall things first 
before I leave this operating system.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,880
Think of it as like a proper send off.

67
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,000
Like when you're about to move to a new house,

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,680
you would clean up the old house first 
before you move into the new one, right?

69
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,840
So I like doing that pretty much.

70
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,040
And that's where I would like to 
thank our great sponsor, SD Maid SE.

71
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,160
Especially my great friend 
Darken, the guy who made it,

72
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,320
for sponsoring not just this video but 
my entire life of content creation.

73
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,920
I wouldn't be here making all 
these videos if it weren't for him.

74
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,720
However, even though it's just a one-time sponsor,

75
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,560
I still appreciate the app as if 
it has helped me the entire life.

76
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,960
So please check him out in 
the description below as well.

77
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,120
More about the app at the 
end, at the sponsor segment.

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,960
Right.

79
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's get right into…

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
Oh will you focus, baby?

81
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,440
Are you going to focus?

82
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,360
Right.

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,280
Let's get close enough and let's 
start uninstalling some stuff.

84
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:27,000
So let's just yeet yeet yeet...

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,640
And we confirm deletion.

86
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,200
Look at that.

87
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,280
How it just clicks the uninstall button 
for you and all you have to do is press OK.

88
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,440
Ain't that great?

89
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,600
Ooh, that's a lot of apps going away.

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,240
Ayyy, there we go.

91
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,480
We're back to really really clean one.

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,820
Heh heh heh.

93
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,160
Alright, fooling around aside.

94
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
We're going to get real serious.

95
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,520
And as always, I got them prepared already.

96
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,200
Since we're just jumping to PixelOS, 
we're not really doing anything.

97
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,960
We just need the usual stuff.

98
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,600
Odin, PixelOS, and PixelOS Recovery.

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,800
How simple is that?

100
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,280
Right, let's get right into it.

101
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,080
I can't believe I'm going to be doing this

102
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,040
because I'm sitting at the edge of my chair

103
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,680
just squishing my camera stand like 
how I would do to an anime degenerate.

104
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,000
And as always, the instructions 
are always available on XDAForums.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,800
Please do check it out when 
you need more references.

106
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,160
And according to the instructions,

107
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,240
it says to make sure your 
device's bootloader is unlocked.

108
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,720
Let's check that.

109
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,280
Wait a flippin' second, I 
don't even need to check that.

110
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,480
It's already unlocked.

111
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Because you need to have your bootloader 
unlocked if you need to have custom OS.

112
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,640
However you can lock your bootloader,

113
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,560
but you would need to tell the bootloader 
the signature of the OS it needs.

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,080
Which is usually a massive hassle, so 
nobody really does that realistically.

115
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,600
So let's skip that.

116
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,360
Power off device and get into download mode.

117
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,040
Okay, let's get into download mode.

118
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,160
Here we go.

119
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,880
Let's press the power button.

120
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,640
Power off.

121
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,160
So much faster than before.

122
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,400
Download the recovery image for your device.

123
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,360
So we're going to be on PixelOS's website

124
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,080
and we're going to scroll down to Galaxy 
Note 10+, at least that's for my device.

125
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,640
And we're going to get the recovery, 
which will take us to SourceForge

126
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,240
and we get the latest version as usual.

127
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,520
Oh while you're here, you might as well download 
the latest build as well of the ROM itself.

128
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,600
Don't forget that.

129
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,560
And over here we're going to need to 
rename the image file to "recovery".

130
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,680
Keep in mind that this has 
to be called "recovery.img"

131
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,040
because Odin is going to read 
inside a layer of an archive

132
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,240
and know, "oh this goes straight 
to recovery, okay I see."

133
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,360
Because for whatever weird reasons, we 
can't put image files directly into Odin.

134
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,840
We have to archive it into an archive called tar.

135
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,720
How dumb is it?

136
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,160
Press okay and there should be 
a resulting tar file as usual.

137
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,000
And now we open up Odin and we're going 
to get this baby into download mode.

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,680
So volume up and down, which 
I can mash with my fingers.

139
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,560
And the USB cable.

140
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,280
Eyyy...

141
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,680
Going into download mode by pressing volume up

142
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,080
and we're here as usual.

143
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,200
Now what we need to do is click AP, get 
into that folder and click "recovery.tar".

144
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,160
It has to be on AP, keep in mind, 
or else you'll brick your device.

145
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,000
And now we just send her.

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,520
Wee!

147
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,920
You would sometimes accidentally end up getting 
back into your Android OS after flashing,

148
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,480
but that's perfectly fine.

149
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,720
As long as you still have access to 
your recovery, that's perfectly fine.

150
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Restart, recovery, we're taking this the lazy way.

151
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,920
While you wait, you can also close 
Odin, we don't need that anymore.

152
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,760
But instead, we're going to need our terminal.

153
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,400
We'll get to you in a moment.

154
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,120
Okay, we're in PixelOS recovery as 
you can clearly see, PixelOS up here.

155
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
And what we're going to do is [Factory reset],

156
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,560
which means we're going to wipe 
everything real clean again,

157
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
just like I said in that video.

158
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,280
So here we go.

159
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,800
Format data.

160
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,040
Format cache.

161
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,480
Right, now that we're all cleaned up,

162
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,360
[Apply update] and [Apply from ADB].

163
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,360
And if you remember from the previous video 
or any other Android flashing guide video,

164
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,400
then you would know by now.

165
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,680
[adb sideload]

166
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,200
Then the file name.

167
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,480
And we send her.

168
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,040
Now with PixelOS, GApps is built in.

169
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,520
So we don't really need to install 
MindTheGApps at all, so we just wait here.

170
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,240
And then we'll be done by then.

171
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,480
It's real dead simple.

172
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,000
If you want a root, you might 
also want to flash Magisk as well.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,440
Uhhhhhhhhhh.

174
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,280
Uhhhhhhhhhhhh.

175
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,440
Gosh, if flashing could be any faster, honestly.

176
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,160
I'm talking about you, Apple and Google.

177
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,480
Gosh.

178
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,160
Oh, fuck.

179
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,480
I'm going to stop complaining.

180
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,960
I'm just going to sit here and wait.

181
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,680
Maybe drink some water.

182
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,160
I don't have my tea this time.

183
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,000
Six thousand years later.

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,840
Ah, finally, we're done.

185
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,360
Now we just Format data once more.

186
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,400
And just reboot.

187
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,280
And in theory, we should have a clean PixelOS,

188
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:48,600
and everything will be happily ever after.

189
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,920
Just as I thought you were about to be finished,

190
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,840
that was almost misleadingly fast.

191
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,000
Damn, the loading bar takes a 
while for you to come out, eh?

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,320
You cheeky little bastard.

193
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,040
Oh, that was fast.

194
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,440
There was no warning right there.

195
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,880
What the fuck?

196
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,080
Okay, let's get through the setup as usual.

197
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,600
Hopefully this should be fast.

198
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,840
I really just want to finish recording 
and start playing Blue Archive again.

199
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,880
Oh, you bet it will take a few minutes.

200
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,720
Gosh darn.

201
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,560
Oh, finally.

202
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,400
Finally, we're moving.

203
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,680
My camera is almost running 
out of batteries, holy shit.

204
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,880
I'll get to you later,

205
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,280
and I'll get to you later,

206
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,880
later.

207
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,640
Screw your locations.

208
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,320
There we go.

209
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,820
PixelOS.

210
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,600
That's pretty much it.

211
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,480
There's really not much for me to say.

212
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,320
It's just your old bog standard PixelOS.

213
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,760
But now I'm going to set this up off camera,

214
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,640
and that's pretty much it.

215
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,240
Thank you all so much for watching.

216
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,480

218
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,120
which are gaming content, VTubing content.

219
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,080
And I appreciate the massive 
amount of new subscribers

220
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,080
that I've been getting from 
that previous Android video.

221
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,480
So thank you all so so so so so much for watching.

222
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,880
And with that said, it's ya girl Melori,

223
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,920
and I'll catch you guys on 
the next video or stream.

224
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,880
Otsu-Melo!

225
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
See ya!

226
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,680
Oh yeah, with that said, be sure to 
check out our sponsor, SD Maid SE.

227
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,240
Here you go.

228
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Tired of slowness and long loading?

229
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,680
Want to make more space for your stuff?

230
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,720
Well SD Maid SE is here to help.

231
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,000
SD Maid SE is a junk cleaner made 
by an indie developer named Darken.

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,720
Some apps tend to leave leftover files we 
don't need after we're done using them.

233
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,200
That's where SD Maid SE comes in to help.

234
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,720
Now you can do that manually, but time is money.

235
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,720
With SD Maid SE, you can 
automate a good deal of that,

236
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,960
and leave precious times to the 
things that really matter the most.

237
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,560
Unlike other system junk cleaners,

238
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,560
SD Maid SE does not collect any 
form of personally identifiable info

239
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,680
that could be sold to scummy 
data miners for profit.

240
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,040
Nor does it bombard you with a 
fuckton of ads that waste your time.

241
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,720
Like I said, time is money.

242
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,440
SD Maid SE heavily relies on the generosity 
of the community to stay alive and going.

243
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,560
App improvements happen with 
the help and contribution

244
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,240
from the great community in GitHub and Discord.

245
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,800
So if there's any bug with 
the app, you're never alone.

246
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
What are you waiting for?

247
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,640
Get your phone cleaned with SD Maid SE

248
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,080
on the Google Play Store or 
GitHub in the description below.

249
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,280
Oh, maybe I should clean my phone screen too.

250
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,680
With that, thanks to Darken Development

251
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,120
for encouraging me to walk 
forward in content creation.

252
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,143
Catch yanext time!
