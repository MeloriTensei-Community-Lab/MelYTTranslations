1
00:00:10,183 --> 00:00:12,743
It was a midnight,

2
00:00:12,743 --> 00:00:17,850
all quiet and calm, with nothing but just the computer running.

3
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,330
I figured, it would be the right time for me to work on my model.

4
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:41,700
I sat down, opened Unity on the project I've been updating my model with.

5
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:49,560
As you may know, hairs and skirts are among the things that have physics,

6
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:53,510
and it is always up to the model rigger to make sure they work as intended.

7
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:57,330
So that day, I was planning a work on improving on those.

8
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,680
Thus, I do a series around checks,

9
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:03,700
by getting into play mode, and moving my body parts.

10
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,910
Hair looks good,

11
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:11,950
skirt looks good, until I move the leg up.

12
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:23,290
I figured it was just a one off, so I wanted to double check with both legs.

13
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:38,780
The skirt was flaring up.

14
00:01:38,783 --> 00:01:40,660
This is where I got confused.

15
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,040
Thus I got onto Google.

16
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,630
Frustratingly, with no definitive info about it,

17
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:49,610
I spent weeks upon weeks of research,

18
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:54,200
until I stumbled upon this Twitter thread, in only Japanese.

19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,710
It explained everything I need to know.

20
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:02,830
I couldn't find any useful articles

21
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,290
on skirt collission measures for VRM Spring Bone,

22
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,960
so I would like to summarize my findings so far in my own way.

23
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:15,690
VRM Spring Bone in comparison to Dynamic Bone:

24
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:18,150
- The direction of the bone's motion will not be fixed/constant.

25
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,410
The size of radius cannot be changed individually

26
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:25,650
(The size within the same size group is always constant).

27
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,590
However, since there is currently no means

28
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,580
to solve these problems at mass.

29
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:37,110
I chose to "brute force" my way to find out.

30
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,580
However, for the aforementioned points,

31
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:43,550
if the collider is simply placed along the mesh shape of the legs,

32
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,250
the radius [of the skirt] will spill out

33
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,060
along the spherical surface of the collider.

34
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:51,780
so, let's add one more row (or more) colliders

35
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:56,530
inside the foot placed along the legs.

36
00:02:56,533 --> 00:03:00,830
That way, the skirt [colliding] radius will be pushed out by the "board,

37
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:05,010
so there will be less spills than with just a "sphere".

38
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:09,060
In this case, each collider should be small,

39
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:11,030
and the accuracy can be improved

40
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,160
by arranging many colliders in a row.

41
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:18,110
The main reason "why" the colliders are placed "on the inside"

42
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:22,050
is that if they are placed on the outside,

43
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:29,260
they will interfere with the skirt when you're standing still

44
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:32,760
They also brought up a tool in booth that automates the whole process,

45
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:35,030
but we'll get to that later.

46
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:37,900
If the hit radius is a bit too large,

47
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,590
and it sticks out a bit due to its interactions with the collider,

48
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,110
adjust the settings by adjusting the Gravity value, etc.

49
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:47,480
to make the behavior more natural.

50
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:51,730
VRM is a standard that shows the design concept

51
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,940
"specialized for standing figures"

52
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:56,190
when viewing in official applications such as VRoid.

53
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,960
However, in recent years, third party apps

54
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:01,560
have appeared one after another,

55
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:04,260
and there are more and more situations

56
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:05,810
where intense motion is needed.

57
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:08,630
I would like to conclude this thread

58
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:13,090
with my sincere hope that major action will be taken as soon as possible.

59
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,690
We may still be in the process of researching,

60
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:20,440
but we believe that the demand to create VRM avatars

61
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:23,060
from non-VRoid application will increase in the future,

62
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:27,434
and we hope that this will be of help to those people.

63
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,980
Now, if you don't understand much of it, bones are the points A to B

64
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:33,130
that determines how an object morphs.

65
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,800
Whereas colliders determine how it should touch each other,

66
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,390
and not pass straight through.

67
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,330
But in VRM's case, it is usually only a sphere.

68
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,980
With the two in play, becomes something that gives us the visual representation

69
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:47,810
of an object is touching another.

70
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:52,560
With that, I checked how the colliders between my legs and skirt…

71
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,660
Uh…

72
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,010
Yeah…

73
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:57,610
Something's gotta be done about that.

74
00:04:57,616 --> 00:04:59,710
Considering this being a model issue for me,

75
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,360
and others who have generated their models in Vroid,

76
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:04,460
we have to take that to Blender to fix it.

77
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:06,430
Now, if you didn't understand what that was,

78
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:09,680
the starting point of the bones are a little too low to allow the skirts

79
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:12,430
to properly work when the legs move at an extreme angle,

80
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:14,580
such as squatting and sitting.

81
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,080
To fix the skirt rigging, I recommend you to check out

82
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,500
Pierrick and Kana Fuyuko's skirt rigging guide in Blender.

83
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,410
But to put simply, I'm gonna summarize what I've done here.

84
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,980
Separate the dress, clean up unnecessary vertices and bones,

85
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:31,890
make sure they're symmetrical, if your model has two layers of skirt, join the vertices,

86
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:35,260
create new sets of bones and rig them and weight paint them,

87
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:40,280
rejoin the skirt back to the model, test them out, and then finally export it.

88
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:43,560
Now that we're through this part, let me hand this off to LiveMel.

89
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:44,880
Thank you, VoiceOverMel!

90
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:49,380
Right, so we have imported the package of UniVRM,

91
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,580
and I've also imported two different versions of my models,

92
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,980
so I can show you how it actually makes a difference.

93
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:58,750
Right, for this first phase, we're gonna do it the wrong way.

94
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,160
So have we not re-rigged the model,

95
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,850
this is how it's going to look like.

96
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,580
So now that we've put it in, you can see that the line starts here instead of up here,

97
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:15,300
and there is a couple of colliders only on the thigh region, as you can see.

98
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,780
If we do it as it is, if we leave it as it is, and we try compiling this,

99
00:06:20,783 --> 00:06:25,660
we're gonna have the exact same result as what we saw from the very beginning of this video.

100
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:34,830
So we go down to hips, upper leg, and move it up, you can see that it's flaring up.

101
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,640
Well, to explain what happened, this is what happened.

102
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:42,140
If you look into this branch of this leg that we just pulled up,

103
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:44,890
you can see that the skirt bones are under it,

104
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:49,190
so that means when we rotate the leg, the skirt's following suit.

105
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,060
Well, technically, you could just ask yourself,

106
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:55,680
Oh, gee Mel, why couldn't you just take these things and throw it to the hips?

107
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:59,530
So if we do that, when we move the leg up,

108
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,980
you can see that the skirt's phasing through.

109
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:04,890
That's because if we look into the secondary,

110
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:09,140
which is where all the colliders for objects go,

111
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:14,582
you can see that if we just look from the front,

112
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:20,280
that the bone completely phase right through the colliders of it,

113
00:07:20,283 --> 00:07:24,580
and then the collider ball just misses it barely,

114
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:29,460
as you can see, like this, this barely, this amount of barely.

115
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:34,180
Like if we click on the character, you can see it barely misses through it.

116
00:07:34,183 --> 00:07:38,190
And you may ask yourself, we could just increase the size of these balls.

117
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,460
Sure, we can.

118
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:48,100
So we go up to the skirt section, and then we raise the radius like this.

119
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,600
But this could result in this, this thing flying out of control.

120
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,860
That's because the starting point is under, I mean, I wouldn't say under,

121
00:07:57,866 --> 00:08:01,080
but right on where the thigh is at.

122
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,660
And the ball is just outside the thigh,

123
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:09,610
so it's literally interacting side by side with the thigh.

124
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:12,530
Now, no matter how we do it, no matter how we fix it,

125
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:16,210
it's going to be really, really hard to fix it if we don't re-reave the skirt.

126
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:18,780
But I'm still going to show you how to fix that.

127
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:24,310
So first up, we're gonna create something that I would call the bowl method.

128
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:27,880
Because if you refer to that Twitter thread earlier,

129
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,380
they say to make it in the plane method.

130
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:35,730
In my opinion, the plane method could end up just sliding far off.

131
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:39,930
So I prefer the bowl method so that we can have like,

132
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:42,140
kind of like if you look from the top,

133
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,830
a bowl-like shape that will contain the bones of the skirt in place.

134
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:50,750
But that definitely would mean if you move your thighs to the side,

135
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,380
the skirt will follow suit.

136
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:56,080
But honestly, this is the spring bones limitation.

137
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,410
So that's as far as we can go.

138
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:02,060
However, it still solves some bit of the problem.

139
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,750
Right, let's begin with one thing.

140
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,530
Since we know that the starting point of the colliders are further down,

141
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:10,330
we're gonna take down the ones in the top.

142
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,760
We kind of don't need that because there really isn't a point for that.

143
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:18,197
Let's just remove that.

144
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:25,680
And then, we create a brand new one for the second, like this.

145
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:31,710
And then we'll try to copy as much of the parameters as we can, like this.

146
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:38,880
And then now we create a brand new one that goes to the side, like,

147
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:42,610
not like that, like this.

148
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:48,390
And then we just move that forward a little bit,

149
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,830
and then create a new one that is on the other side of that collider.

150
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,830
Like, kind of something like this.

151
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,560
Like, you can grasp the concept.

152
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,160
Something along that concept.

153
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,390
Now, repeat that for a few more layers.

154
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,930
And then after that, you go to secondary.

155
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:13,030
What you want to do is to go to secondary,

156
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:18,500
and then assign the leg to those skirt colliders.

157
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,610
Now, this is where another new problem comes up.

158
00:10:21,616 --> 00:10:22,960
Since we've did it with the leg,

159
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:27,510
that means the entire skirt is going to interact with that bolt.

160
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:28,980
How do we prevent that?

161
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:29,880
Well, simple.

162
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:36,290
You just right-click on the leg, and you create a new child.

163
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:38,500
An empty GameObject child.

164
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:49,450
And we call it, say, for example, ForSkirtFrontLeft.

165
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:55,360
And then, instead of using the upper leg spring bone collider group,

166
00:10:55,366 --> 00:11:01,130
we move this thing to this thing,

167
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:07,930
and then we take these to the secondary as the collider groups.

168
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,140
However, this can be quite a tedious task,

169
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:13,910
especially when you need to do a couple of rows for each of the angles,

170
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:17,000
like, say, front, back, left, and right.

171
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,580
So I'm not really going to do it on this tutorial.

172
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:23,560
However, I have pre-made one for myself.

173
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,710
This is an example.

174
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:29,180
So if we go into the legs,

175
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:34,450
you would see that I have created a dedicated section called upper leg colliders.

176
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,060
Each of them have, say, we have the center one,

177
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:40,390
and then we have the ones for the sides.

178
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,290
Front, left, front side.

179
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:47,960
Basically, I've covered this much.

180
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:49,880
If you look at all the circles together,

181
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:56,160
so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, kind of that.

182
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,600
This much angle.

183
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,910
And then we appropriately assigned it to the skirt colliders

184
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,330
according to the bones that it is facing,

185
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:11,010
so that it only interacts with that set angle.

186
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:13,430
So we haven't changed anything with the skirt colliders yet,

187
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,380
but we have changed something with the legs.

188
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:17,780
You can see a little bit of puffing.

189
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:24,130
That's because I've done colliders on the upper end as well.

190
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,810
So it may have accidentally interacted with it a little bit.

191
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:29,860
As you can see, something like that.

192
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:30,830
See?

193
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,560
It kind of touched it a little.

194
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:34,310
I probably shouldn't have done that.

195
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:37,290
Right, so let's move a leg up.

196
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:42,110
You can see that it is still going a little wild.

197
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:44,180
That's because I got the upper row.

198
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:48,030
If I have removed the upper row, and like that.

199
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,960
Okay, we've removed most of the top, the upper rows.

200
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:55,130
Now you can see that on that side, it's no longer puffing.

201
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:58,040
So now let's move the leg up.

202
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:04,160
You can see that it is kind of hugging onto it.

203
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:06,580
This is what I mean by the bowl method.

204
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,600
So you can see like this side and this side is hugging onto this one,

205
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,980
and it's carrying it in a straight line.

206
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:17,380
So when we're moving it to the sides like this,

207
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,710
it may kind of phase out.

208
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,460
That's primarily because, as you can see,

209
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:28,890
the starting line is still...

210
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,480
Let's just say this particular row of legs have gone

211
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:35,500
way too far that it has been pushed out.

212
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,610
But at least you can see the idea of what I meant,

213
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:42,830
and also what the twitter thread is talking about.

214
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:48,000
However, I do think that the twitter thread explains it way better than I do.

215
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,350
But do let me know in the comments below

216
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,210
if you think my explanation is sufficient.

217
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:54,510
Try to improve on the bowl method,

218
00:13:54,516 --> 00:14:01,110
and try to have slightly smaller colliders with more sets of rows.

219
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:08,010
That way it would make it way more precise for the way skirts are behaving.

220
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:13,210
But aside from that, this is actually the proper solution to it.

221
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:17,060
Which honestly, in my opinion, it really does suck.

222
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:22,110
But because Vroid is quite a restrictive format,

223
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:24,810
primarily because of its initial purpose,

224
00:14:24,816 --> 00:14:27,980
we can't really do anything about it for now.

225
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:31,310
With that said, there too exist automated tools that automate this,

226
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:33,680
such as this tool from Fuji Sunflower.

227
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:37,610
Right, so I'm gonna demonstrate this tool that I found by Fuji Sunflower.

228
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:40,380
You can see that as well in the Twitter thread.

229
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:45,130
And because of this Twitter thread, I actually went in to experiment with it,

230
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,980
to see whether it suits my case.

231
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:51,630
To use this, make sure that you know which version of VRM that you're using.

232
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:55,660
Say for example, if your model is in VRM version 0,

233
00:14:55,666 --> 00:15:00,410
please use Auto VRMColliderGroup, the one with the word in group.

234
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,140
Because Fuji Sunflower will provide two files,

235
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:06,512
one's called AutoVRMCollider and Auto VRMColliderGroup.

236
00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:08,730
The one with the "Group" is for version 0,

237
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:11,040
and the one without the "Group" is for version 1.

238
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:13,290
With the package from Fuji Sunflower installed,

239
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:19,480
let's head on up here, where we have the only item called Auto VRMColliderGroup.

240
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:20,730
So let's test this out.

241
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:26,310
And there will be an option for English, so do press that if you speak English.

242
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:30,860
And this is where you'll be given a whole lot of settings that you can adjust to.

243
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:33,580
For example, how large the radius you want to be,

244
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:37,010
and how many colliders you want it per section to be.

245
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:39,280
And you can also have a preset for that as well.

246
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:42,950
For example, the radius, would you like a default 1?

247
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,450
Or would you like a multiplier of 2 for that?

248
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,110
And would you like individual fingers for colliders?

249
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:56,938
And do you like the colliders to be on the right, center, left, or extra?

250
00:15:56,938 --> 00:16:00,530
Okay, while I'm recording, I just figured out what these adjustments actually do.

251
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:03,880
So these are just categories for where things are.

252
00:16:03,883 --> 00:16:07,540
So say for example, on the left it would be for the left arm, left finger, left leg,

253
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,510
and right for the for the respective.

254
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:12,530
And center is mostly for the center of the body.

255
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:14,498
My bad.

256
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:17,178
Forgive me for the mistake.

257
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:19,997
Now on to the regular programming.

258
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:24,410
However, I'm going to do this from the perspective of an idiot like me.

259
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,830
But from my perspective as an idiot,

260
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:31,430
what I think is that I'm going to clear out all the colliders I've had.

261
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:33,450
So now we have no colliders on the legs.

262
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,080
And then we automatically add them.

263
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,640
So now there will be a preset collider that the plugin is using.

264
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:43,260
Which looks relatively okay honestly.

265
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:47,010
Though it may be a little over over stretching a little bit.

266
00:16:47,016 --> 00:16:49,480
We could adjust that with the preset like this.

267
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:50,960
Then we just add auto.

268
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:54,980
However, the 50% is a little bit on the smaller side I gotta be honest.

269
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:57,330
So I'll switch back to the 100%.

270
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,710
And let's inspect the leg.

271
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:01,790
Bang on size for the thighs,

272
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,200
but a little bit on the larger side for the lower legs.

273
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,930
I'm not really too sure what Fuji Sunflower is working with.

274
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:11,730
But yeah.

275
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:15,730
And then we scroll down and there will be a button for fixes for skirt.

276
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:20,580
This would add an additional, a few additional colliders in the middle.

277
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:25,030
That serves kind of like a play method in some way.

278
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:29,560
So if we press play right now and try to move the leg up.

279
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:36,910
It looks like it has flew off to the sides.

280
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:43,207
That's because its play method is only focused on the middle.

281
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:51,460
And this is also why I've explained why the play method is still a little bit flawed.

282
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:55,592
Because even if your starting point is above the thighs.

283
00:17:55,592 --> 00:18:00,960
All the other bones down the chain can also fly off to the sides, no matter what.

284
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:06,160
So this is only best suited if you happen to be, say, sitting I guess.

285
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,680
So if we move this leg up, it would follow suit.

286
00:18:09,683 --> 00:18:11,430
And then it will hug in the middle.

287
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:19,080
However, it would work as well for skirt with bones that are like side to side as you can see.

288
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,460
As you can see, one of them flew off to the side as well.

289
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:24,090
So that's not really too good.

290
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:25,630
Yikes.

291
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:28,710
Which is why I always encourage the bow method.

292
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:31,360
Though I haven't really seen anyone use the bow method.

293
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:34,680
So yeah, your mileage may vary with this particular plugin.

294
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:40,310
So with the thigh adjusted, we extend one on the left and the right.

295
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:44,110
And hopefully we could bring up also a back as well.

296
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:49,860
This would create kind of a pseudo-bowl method that is similar to what I've just done.

297
00:18:49,866 --> 00:18:53,410
And as you can see, the bow method proves to be kind of working.

298
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:57,780
Though the thigh collider for the auto-generated one may be

299
00:18:57,783 --> 00:19:02,710
a little bit on the slightly larger side so it's not captured in the dead center.

300
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:05,210
But it kind of does work to some extent.

301
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:10,900
However, if your upper thigh region has colliders that are a lot bigger,

302
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,830
it could also make this part of the skirt puffed up.

303
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,900
So again, your mileage may vary.

304
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,730
However, if you press the fixed spring bone button,

305
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:27,980
it expands the bones to pretty much as large as it can

306
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:32,730
until it barely touches one another to basically make sure

307
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:36,200
that there's full complete coverage of the bones.

308
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,590
However, I don't really quite recommend it

309
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,760
because it's on the slightly larger side.

310
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:44,760
And there's this too, which should do the same thing.

311
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,900
Now I've cleaned up my project and imported

312
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,000
VRM's SpringBoneTool and VRM's SkirtTool from NALULUNA.

313
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,010
Now with this particular one, if you want to fix the skirt issue,

314
00:19:55,016 --> 00:19:57,980
you have to have both of the tools imported into this project.

315
00:19:57,983 --> 00:20:01,410
And you have a brand new tab that is called VRM tools.

316
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,930
And there will be three sections of it, which is the SpringBoneTool,

317
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:07,400
and then the SkirtTool, and then the cleanup tool.

318
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,040
So what does the cleanup tool actually does?

319
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:14,730
Well, it basically whatever it has done but has left over kind of,

320
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:19,730
like say for example, it has created a child, like I said previously,

321
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:23,650
that has been left over and never been used by this thing.

322
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,380
Like say for example, you have removed all the colliders,

323
00:20:26,383 --> 00:20:29,090
then this tool is made to clean it all up.

324
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:31,150
Whereas what we're going to be focusing right now,

325
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,160
since we're starting from scratch,

326
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,530
is we're going to begin with the SpringBoneTool.

327
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,750
Start with that,

328
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,450
and then let it auto detect your model that is in the project.

329
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,360
And it's going to want you to unpack the prefab first.

330
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,110
So we're going to press that for now,

331
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:48,230
and then have it auto detect everything.

332
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:52,910
So everything that has bones that are meant to have colliders are detected.

333
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,130
And then on the bottom page,

334
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:58,680
there will be load optimal settings and load extreme settings.

335
00:20:58,683 --> 00:21:01,560
However, if we scroll up a tiny bit, since we completely missed that,

336
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:04,810
you can see that there will be parameters that where you can set

337
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:07,110
all the colliders for everything you need to know.

338
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:11,830
Say for your upper chest, for your torso, because this is a two-in-one pack,

339
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:16,500
so you can take care of colliders relating to your head as well and your hair.

340
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,200
So say for example, if you have issues with

341
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,680
hair going around your body,

342
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:24,810
you can also take care of those as well.

343
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,160
So we're going to be very focused on the lower body then.

344
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,030
So you can mess around with the parameters,

345
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:32,200
but I'm going to keep it default for now.

346
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,952
As I've mentioned previously, I am pretty much an idiot.

347
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:38,680
So we're going to click on load optimal settings.

348
00:21:38,683 --> 00:21:44,790
And it's going to set some default parameters that are suitable for this model.

349
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,730
And then we create the spring bones like this.

350
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:53,280
So you would see that it has created a huge set of colliders and bones for it.

351
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:55,080
And everything seems to look fine.

352
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,580
So we can mess around with that a little bit, play around a little bit with that.

353
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,860
But we're not there yet.

354
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:03,080
But let's just play around so we can understand what we're dealing with.

355
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:07,310
So as you can clearly see that the colliders are still not yet in any form of method,

356
00:22:07,316 --> 00:22:09,710
like a bowl method or a plane method.

357
00:22:09,716 --> 00:22:10,480
Nada.

358
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:11,540
None of that.

359
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:16,450
So that means when we do bring up the leg,

360
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:18,210
it's going to slide off.

361
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:24,730
However, with this plugin, you get to see which bones are being interacted with.

362
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:29,630
So you don't have to click out to your model to be able to see it.

363
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:34,410
You can do it in real time, which is pretty awesome with this particular plugin.

364
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:38,680
You can see it as it blinks, which is quite freaking cool.

365
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:41,010
And you can also have in the play mode,

366
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:43,280
this plugin window will automatically switch

367
00:22:43,283 --> 00:22:45,830
to something that's like an auto poser.

368
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:51,460
And it will auto pose for you so you can do some testings like say walking.

369
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:56,660
And it'll walk on its own and you get to see the result.

370
00:22:57,766 --> 00:23:00,030
And you can make it run as well.

371
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:03,290
You're gonna make it do some dances with it.

372
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:08,790
And you get to see the bones in action to see if it's actually behaving correctly.

373
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,260
Though the first two is heavily focused on mostly on the upper body's end.

374
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:17,310
As you can see, things look pretty good in hindsight.

375
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:20,230
So I guess we'll just leave it at that for now.

376
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:23,080
So, let's just stop it right here and let's get back to focus.

377
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:26,310
So now that we're done with the base spring bones,

378
00:23:26,316 --> 00:23:29,380
we're gonna hop over to the next tool, the SkirtTool.

379
00:23:29,383 --> 00:23:32,160
And now we're gonna need to make it auto detect this model once again

380
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,930
and auto detect all the skirt root bones.

381
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:36,680
So if you're in a situation like mine

382
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:40,040
where the SkirtTool literally couldn't find the skirt bones,

383
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:44,530
that's because it's expecting a certain set of names but it found nothing,

384
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,610
then you'll have to find it yourself.

385
00:23:46,616 --> 00:23:50,080
So in my case, when I rigged the model, I put it in the spine

386
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,900
because I believe that in terms of bone arrangement,

387
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,910
it is more suited to be on the spine than the hips.

388
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,410
So I put it there.

389
00:23:57,416 --> 00:24:00,760
So that means we gotta bring them all here like this.

390
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:03,090
So we just drag it in.

391
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:04,160
Boop.

392
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:08,160
So now we got all the skirt bones in green dots as you can see right here.

393
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,630
It's properly detected now.

394
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:10,810
So now let's scroll down

395
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,980
and then there will be three sets of recommended settings.

396
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:16,160
So these three recommended sets of settings

397
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:20,760
are basically what determines how we should make the colliders behave.

398
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:25,530
So there will be documentations included in the downloads section

399
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:27,400
and it will be to the Google Docs.

400
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,510
However, it's in primarily Japanese

401
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:34,180
and the English documentation they provided is super Google translated.

402
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:38,860
So I'm gonna try my best with my interpretation of my understanding to explain what it does.

403
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:46,330
So the first setting is to make it humongous but the interaction is quite negligible.

404
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:52,180
So basically, despite the huge size, it behaves kind of like a soft push.

405
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:56,880
So when we press play, the sides may puff up a little bit but that's okay.

406
00:24:56,883 --> 00:25:01,250
That's just the way I rigged my skirt accidentally.

407
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,730
But if we move the leg up, you can see that they're interacting properly.

408
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:09,330
Almost properly, I would say to some extent.

409
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,750
And then we can kind of move the leg out a little bit.

410
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,840
It may phase out a little bit primarily because that's how I rigged the skirt.

411
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:20,750
Sadly, if I had rigged a corner one, it would also interact accordingly.

412
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,030
So the more precise you have rigged your skirt, the better.

413
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:28,010
However, it is doing everything correctly.

414
00:25:28,016 --> 00:25:32,560
It's going up and down rather than hugging it like the bowl method that I did before.

415
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,810
So that's one thing that's interesting.

416
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:42,880
And when we have it do walking and running, the hands may face some issues.

417
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:46,060
Primarily because the skirt was puffing up from up here.

418
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:51,510
But I'm sure I'll be able to solve it through settling some parameters in the skirt too later.

419
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:55,500
So say for example, if we put it on dance mode,

420
00:25:56,916 --> 00:26:02,930
you can see that the interactions with the leg seems like it's actually doing its job.

421
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:04,110
Almost.

422
00:26:04,116 --> 00:26:06,880
When I said almost, I mean literally almost.

423
00:26:06,883 --> 00:26:08,830
But it is quite impressive.

424
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:12,510
It is definitely way better than my own implementation to this.

425
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:15,610
So once again, like I said in the previous tool,

426
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:20,210
your mileage may vary, but I do think this particular tool is significantly better.

427
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:23,310
Right, let's get out of the play mode and let's try out the second settings.

428
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:28,360
So if we do the second settings and we try to remove all the colliders for now,

429
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:31,790
and we apply the second settings and we create skirt colliders,

430
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:40,110
it's going to do this um weirdly angled kind of plane method to some extent.

431
00:26:40,116 --> 00:26:42,700
A plane-ish bowl method.

432
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,610
As you can see by the lines, it looks kind of like that.

433
00:26:45,616 --> 00:26:50,310
So when we press play, this time my top of the skirt didn't puff up.

434
00:26:50,316 --> 00:26:53,930
So that's probably what suits my situation.

435
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:59,262
And when we move the leg up, you can see that it's actually spreading out correctly.

436
00:26:59,262 --> 00:27:04,790
And say for example if I move my leg to the sides, it may kind of phase out a little bit,

437
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,480
but that's because these bones are interacting with these by accident.

438
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,340
And also I am also bringing the leg up in such an extreme unnatural angle.

439
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:17,959
But if we do it like in a natural angle,

440
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:21,330
something like this may happen if we move like that.

441
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:24,250
That's because of the way I rig my skirt once again.

442
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,710
But yeah, we're gonna reset the pose and have it walk and run.

443
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:30,610
So as you can see when walking, it looks pretty fine.

444
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:33,360
The hands are actually pushing the skirt as we walk.

445
00:27:33,366 --> 00:27:36,380
And then when we're running, it's actually interacting properly.

446
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:40,910
So a little teeny tiny bit of phasing as you can see over there, but it is not as bad.

447
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:43,500
And then when we have it to dance,

448
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,560
it looks pretty decent.

449
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:54,750
We're gonna have it move a little more extremely so we can see how things go.

450
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:59,710
And honestly this would be the best that I would give it,

451
00:27:59,716 --> 00:28:02,090
but I really do think this particular two,

452
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:05,530
this particular bundle of two is definitely worth the money.

453
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:08,180
Right, let's get out of the play mode and let's try out the third method.

454
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:12,530
I haven't really tried the third method, but I would love to try the third method somehow.

455
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:18,090
Okay, so it's like multiple rows of method number two.

456
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:22,710
Right, let's see how it's like when we turn it on.

457
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,580
Okay, on the upper end it seems to puff out a little bit, but that's not too bad.

458
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,160
How about walking?

459
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,910
So the same outcome as we faced on preset number one.

460
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:37,200
So it's kind of like a mix of one and two with one with many rows,

461
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,880
and then two with the smaller collider size I assume.

462
00:28:40,883 --> 00:28:42,900
So what if we have it running?

463
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,330
It's not too bad.

464
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:48,580
Right, let's get back to T-pose and let's bring up a leg.

465
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:55,200
So it kind of is puffing up primarily because of the back colliders right here.

466
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,480
So the reason why there's three different collider settings, that's because of that.

467
00:28:59,483 --> 00:29:03,730
So many different rigs may have significantly different scenarios.

468
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:07,710
So it would be either of the three that would suit your case.

469
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:11,710
So for my case, it would be the second settings.

470
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:16,760
But yeah, let's have it dance so we can see if it looks fine anyways.

471
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:19,540
I know it's already not that good when we put the leg up,

472
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:25,090
but at least it's kind of worth having a short look to see how it's like.

473
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:27,450
Well, that's actually not too bad, but still,

474
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,280
there are still a little bit of jankiness going on.

475
00:29:30,283 --> 00:29:33,250
But yeah, we can't really do much.

476
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,290
We gotta work with what VRM has provided us.

477
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:38,860
So for my case, I would have to clear out the colliders

478
00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:40,630
and set the second settings instead.

479
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:44,280
So the second settings would be for me instead.

480
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,660
And there you have it!

481
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,430
A fix for the skirt issue!

482
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,610
I hope this solves your issue.

Well, SD Maid SE is here to help!

491
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:26,610
SD Maid SE is a junk cleaner made by an indie developer named Darken.

492
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:30,250
Some apps tend to leave leftover files we don't need after we're done using them.

493
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,730
That's where SD Maid SE comes in to help!

494
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:35,280
Now, you can do that manually, but time is money!

495
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:38,290
With SD Maid SE, you can automate a good deal of that,

496
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:41,480
and leave precious times to the things that really matter the most.

497
00:30:41,483 --> 00:30:43,010
Unlike other system junk cleaners,

00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:46,980
SD Maid SE does not collect any form of personally identifiable info

499
00:30:46,983 --> 00:30:50,260
that could be sold to scummy data miners for profit.

500
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:53,560
Nor does it bombard you with a fuckton of ads that waste your time.

501
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:55,330
Like I said, time is money!

502
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:59,960
SD Maid SE heavily relies on the generosity of the community to stay alive and going.

503
00:30:59,966 --> 00:31:02,130
App improvements happen with the help and contribution

504
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:04,830
from the great community in GitHub and Discord.

505
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:08,410
So if there's any bug with the app, you're never alone!

506
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:09,260
What are you waiting for?

507
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:14,580
Get your phone cleaned with SD Maid SE on the Google Play Store or GitHub in the description below.

508
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,790
Oh, maybe I should clean my phone screen too.

509
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,260
With that, thanks to Darken Development

510
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:20,450
for encouraging me to walk forward in content creation.

511
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,810
Catch you next time!
