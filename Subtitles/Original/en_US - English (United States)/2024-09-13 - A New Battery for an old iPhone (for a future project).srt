Kon-Melo, Kon-Melo, Kon-Melo, Hello, Hello!
(Recorded live on 2024 January 31st)

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:05,380
Kon-Melo, Kon-Melo, Kon-Melo!

3
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:09,210
It's ya Tech Wizardess girl, MeloriTensei!

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:11,560
Hello!

5
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:12,900
Let's get on to business,

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,840
as we said on the thumbnail:

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:15,960
(slam!)

8
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:16,680
iPhone

9
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,000
(laughs)

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,480
Now this phone, this phone right here

11
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:23,580
is a really really old piece of tech.

12
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:26,360
However, I do have something planned for it.

13
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:27,500
For a future project.

14
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,580
SqueakyChair_: "Professional streamer things"
(Mel laughs)

15
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,680
I got a future project for it and I wanna work on it.

16
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:36,830
So one of the fatal problems it has right now

17
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,160
is battery related issues.

18
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,910
So in terms of battery, it is...

19
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,390
It kind of is suffering, I gotta be honest.

20
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,930
Oh, this glove.

21
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:50,700
This glove wouldn't let me...

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,630
Alright, hold on.

23
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:55,730
Looks like we're about to need this thing anyway.

24
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,330
Ja-jaan~ [Ta-da]!

25
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,950
A touch pen!

26
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,700
This is almost everywhere.

27
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,530
You can literally find this literally everywhere.

28
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:04,680
Are you being serious?

29
00:01:04,683 --> 00:01:06,130
It doesn't work with it.

30
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,310
Wait, what?

31
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:11,090
(Sorry, this camera goes out of focus occasionally.)
Is it just me?

32
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:12,630
Oh, this one works.

33
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:15,400
Well, something's wrong with this one then.

34
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,480
So we're gonna be interacting on the screen with this thing.

35
00:01:17,483 --> 00:01:20,710
Because the gloves is preventing me from doing that.

36
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:23,080
So this thing is kind of...

37
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,310
a little dying.

38
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:26,830
And I wanna replace its batteries.

39
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,330
I went on an online marketplace

40
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,810
and I decided...

41
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:32,500
Booyah!

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,760
A third party!

43
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:36,790
Considering that this iPhone is pretty old.

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,560
It is also pretty much close to end of life

45
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,090
in terms of updates.

46
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:44,580
So I don't think it's really worth taking it to a Genius Bar

47
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,110
to actually properly get it replaced.

48
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:47,840
So I figured to myself:

49
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:48,260
"You know what?

50
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,180
Let's just risk this phone a little bit.

51
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:51,660
And try to replace it ourselves.

52
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,290
See how hard can it be"

53
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,960
I would like to preface this with saying that:

54
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:59,260
Please do not do any kind of self-repair

55
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:02,460
unless you're extremely familiar with what you're working with.

56
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:03,340
That goes without saying:

57
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:06,900
"Yes, I have done my prior research before I started the stream."

58
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,310
Though I have not properly done it.

59
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:11,280
I don't have past experience on this.

60
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:14,280
This stream is gonna be my first ever experience on it.

61
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:16,410
But I have opened some phones in the past

62
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,710
with varying success.

63
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:19,680
Probably because some manufacturers decided:

64
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:22,460
"Let's put this ribbon cable somewhere here

65
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,160
where people likely cut"

66
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,130
Boop!

67
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:25,750
And I went

68
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,510
Shiiing!

69
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:29,560
They're gone.

70
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,940
Looking at you, Microsoft.

71
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:32,280
Now, goes without saying:

72
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:34,810
"Do not mess with devices

73
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:36,340
Unless you know what you're dealing with."

74
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:38,330
This includes heating up the device.

75
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,530
However, I don't have a device heater.

76
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,880
So what I got is the next best thing.

77
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:45,160
A hair dryer.
(End up not using it.)

78
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,680
Surely, it won't be that hard.

79
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:47,580
Hopefully not.

80
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,030
Also, in behind the scenes,

81
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:52,760
I've also got an iFixIt guide on my screen.

82
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:54,410
So it can guide me throughout the way.

83
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,510
And a whole lot of the instructions it gave

84
00:02:57,516 --> 00:02:59,530
had something to do with using a whole lot of parts.

85
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,730
I'm gonna be substituting some of the parts.

86
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,130
But I'll be talking about it soon.

87
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,310
OriToka: "What's the battery life though?"

88
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,710
Well...

89
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,780
Let's just say it is...

90
00:03:07,783 --> 00:03:09,300
"Well worn"

91
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,230
Yeah, it's THAT level of well worn.

92
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,730
But it's not just that worn.

93
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,190
It actually does die out at random times.

94
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,710
So like.

95
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:20,340
It actually does just cut the frick out.

96
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:20,960
Right.

97
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,430
Let's begin with...

98
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,710
"Before disassembling,

99
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:26,360
discharge the phone below 25%"

100
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:27,060
Right.

101
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,180
So we're just gonna shut it down

102
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:29,880
and just get straight to work.

103
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:31,400
Let's see what we can do out of this.

104
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,960
First up, case off.

105
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,000
Right.

106
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,580
We're shutting this phone down.

107
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,750
Let's begin with the simplest steps.

108
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,280
There are a lot of various size screws.

109
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:44,150
So we're gonna need a place to actually...

110
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,710
actually keep all this.

111
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:49,030
So I got myself an iFixIt tool kit.

112
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:55,160
Right. "Remove the two 3.6mm long P2 Pentalobe

113
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,750
next to the Lightning connector.

114
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,080
We will find those...

115
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,810
somewhere around...

116
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:00,440
right here.

117
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,680
These two dots you see there.

118
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:04,430
Those are the screws.

119
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:09,680
Right. Following it is...

120
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,480
"Step 2: Anti-clamp instructions"

121
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:12,730
We don't have an anti-clamp.

122
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:15,160
But they say there is an alternative method

123
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,350
to pull this off.

124
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,260
So...

125
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:19,880
"Manual opening procedure"

126
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:21,980
They have this suction cup thing.

127
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,230
Which is included,

128
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:26,360
if you do buy the iFixIt Pro Tech tool kit.

129
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,360
Right here.

130
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:29,110
Though I'm not sure if it actually sticks.

131
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:31,410
Especially with a very very...

132
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:35,180
A really horrifically scratched screen protector.

133
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:38,140
"Using the plastic opening tool"

134
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:39,230
Plastic opening tool?

135
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:40,210
No heat involved?

136
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:41,640
Is it really that weak?

137
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,860
Oh, I see the gaps!

138
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,380
I don't need a hair dryer.

139
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:46,760
Alright, plastic prying tool.

140
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,480
We have that here.

141
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:51,010
It's also in the Pro Tech tool kit, included.

142
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:53,510
But it goes without saying:

143
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:56,360
"Proceed with caution."

144
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,930
There we go.

145
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,560
"There are several clips holding the front panel."

146
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,610
Oh so, these are the clips that they're talking about.

147
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:02,880
The one that I hear a click.

148
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:04,050
It's like, yeah I see it.

149
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:04,800
It's right here.

150
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,130
Like these, these...

151
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,030
These are the clips that they're talking about.

152
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,380
Right.

153
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:12,210
"Open the display at a 90 degree angle

154
00:05:12,216 --> 00:05:14,130
Lean it against something to keep it propped up

155
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,910
when you're working on the phone."

156
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,880
Oh, we're gonna need to get something propped up

157
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:18,940
on the phone, huh?

158
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,580
Where is the display ribbon cable?

159
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,080
Oh, I see it!

160
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,280
It's right here.

161
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:24,110
Here we go.

162
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,530
Water bottle.

163
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:29,360
Now, warning, warning, warning!

164
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:31,030
Everyone who's watching this

165
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:32,390
or the highlights.

166
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,500
Do not bring any liquid near a device!

167
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,140
(laughs)

168
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:40,910
Okay, there we go.

169
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,630
It's kind of leaning agai-

170
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,810
Not leaning, it's kind of just holding onto itself

171
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:46,100
for dear life.

172
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,380
Which I am kind of concerned, actually.

173
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:51,000
"Remove the following Phillips screw

174
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,980
from the battery connector bracket."

175
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:55,410
So, we're gonna need to remove...

176
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,060
the shielding for the battery connector first.

177
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,280
So, let's begin.

178
00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:02,500
So, the smaller screw will have to come off first.

179
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,030
"Remove the battery bracket from the phone."

180
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,460
Come on out, you!

181
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,280
Why are you so attached?

182
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:10,960
"Disconnect the battery"

183
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:12,230
Right.

184
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,380
Spudger.

185
00:06:13,383 --> 00:06:16,430
Actually, spudge it in.
(This camera only has a 30 mins runtime limit,
so I have to reactivate it to fix it each time.)

186
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:18,980
Oh, wow. It's actually really light.

187
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:20,930
Wow, they just came off that easy.

188
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,030
Well, that was easy.

189
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:25,680
Following it, we're gonna remove the front panel cable brackets.

190
00:06:25,683 --> 00:06:26,560
The front panel...

191
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,250
So I assume the display...

192
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,380
So that we can have more workrooms to work with.

193
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:32,810
Though honestly, from first impression.

194
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:36,750
The original battery looks surprisingly intact, actually.

195
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,260
Like, it's not bloating or anything.

196
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,140
Though I have used it for 7 years straight.
(*Actually 5-6 years because I've serviced the battery
at some point with a genius bar.)

197
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:44,580
So, I am quite surprised by the quality.

198
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,780
Right, so we're gonna remove these screws in order.

199
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,350
Make sure you keep the screws in the right spot.

200
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,410
So like, I'm gonna need those smaller...

201
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,530
those smaller tiny screws in this box.

202
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:02,390
Keep it there and nowhere else.

203
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:04,930
It didn't say of anything shocking.

204
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:09,190
So, I assume there's no exposed connectors around here.

205
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,850
Right, let's put her right here.

206
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,750
So we know the orientation.

207
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,850
Right, following that.

208
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,390
We're gonna need to remove the front panel.

209
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:18,980
Goodie.

210
00:07:18,983 --> 00:07:22,760
"In the next 4 steps, take care to pry only on the connectors

211
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:24,180
not their sockets."

212
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:25,230
Right, what's the next one?

213
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,210
"Use a spudger or a fingernail

214
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:30,180
to disconnect the home button cable connector."

215
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,730
That's the home button?!

216
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,580
How blocky do you have?

217
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,830
Like, I get it, I get it.

218
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,730
It contains Touch ID info.

219
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:43,460
But damn, that's huge.

220
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:46,160
"Pull it out by the connector, not by the socket."

221
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,280
I'm trying.

222
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:49,730
But it is having a hard time coming off.

223
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:51,480
If it's not coming off by now...

224
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:52,640
There we go, now it is.

225
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:54,380
I was gonna say if it's not coming off by now.

226
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:56,880
Then I'll probably have to do it off-camera.

227
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:58,210
Right, next.

228
00:07:58,216 --> 00:07:59,910
"Make sure the battery is disconnected.

229
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,410
Use a spudger to disconnect the display data."

230
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,760
Oh, that's the display back here, okay.

231
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:08,030
There we go, that's the display.

232
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:11,100
There's one more though, I can see there's one more connected.

233
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,210
So basically, the touchscreen thingy.

234
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:16,690
The touchscreen sensor thingy.

235
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:17,730
Easy.

236
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,480
So I assume that's all of it?

237
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:21,100
Yup, it is, that's all of it.

238
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,140
There we go, we got the front panel out.

239
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:26,600
Look at the amount of- the absurd amount of connectors they have.

240
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,210
It is simply freaking absurd, like.

241
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,310
So we're gonna put this somewhere safe.

242
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:35,280
Because now we're about to work on the battery itself.

243
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:36,890
Right, so what it says is...

244
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,030
"Peel back the battery adhesive from the bottom right edge."

245
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:44,610
Now we're about to try to pull out the battery adhesives.

246
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:47,160
But because of the fact that I'm using...

247
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,040
"Use your fingers or blunt tweezers

248
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:51,780
Be extra careful when working near the battery

249
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:55,080
Puncturing in lithium can release dangerous chemicals and cause a fire.

250
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,780
Optionally, before proceeding further

251
00:08:56,783 --> 00:09:00,290
You may remove two Phillips screws securing the vibrator

252
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,290
To allow more clearance for extra-"

253
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:04,610
Right, these things, I assume.

254
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:06,710
So now we pull against it.

255
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:08,530
And pull her out.

256
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,810
But don't lean against the thingy.

257
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,730
So go with patience.

258
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,480
And try to pull her out like how you try to pull a snot out.

259
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:16,760
Oh shit.

260
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:19,430
See, this is what I'm trying to avoid.

261
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,630
It's almost ripping apart.

262
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:23,780
It's almost ripping apart, we're not...

263
00:09:23,783 --> 00:09:25,850
This is not gonna go well.

264
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,630
And I hope we don't have to resort to this.

265
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:29,730
Please.

266
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:31,200
Please hold onto it.

267
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,600
Please.

268
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,430
Please let me pull all of it out.

269
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:38,080
Nei nei nei nei nei nei nei nei.

270
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,560
Not all the way in!

271
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:41,200
Don't go back in, don't go back in!

272
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,600
I still got chance, I still got a chance.

273
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:48,230
Give me some clearance.

274
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:55,130
(Sped up video)
(Me struggling to take the strip off...)

275
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,730
I freaking hate these things.

276
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:59,210
And they also shrivel it back inside.

277
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:01,700
That's real bad news, you know.

278
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,100
That's bad news, dayo.

279
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:15,860
(More sped up video)
(More struggling...)

280
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,380
No!

281
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,680
Why?

282
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,880
Why does this happen to me every time?

283
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:24,410
Where it just snaps off the end!

284
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:25,830
No!

285
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,380
Not again!

286
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:33,760
(Gave up and tried using Isopropyl Alcohol
to remove the strip.)
Let's try doing it with extreme caution.

287
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:52,760
(Sped up video again)
(This speed up was at 5000%,
I genuinely can't express how frustrating this was.)

288
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:54,480
Right, we got the adhesives off.

289
00:10:54,483 --> 00:10:55,880
And the battery was moving on its own.

290
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:57,290
So that means...

291
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:59,510
This gloves is preventing me from-

292
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:01,510
There we go.

293
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,080
Oh, you still got a tiny strip left.

294
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,860
Look at this bastard.

295
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,790
So, this is the new replacement battery.

296
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,310
Sure, it's a knockoff and stuff like that.

297
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:14,810
But let's be real.

298
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:17,810
Would you really replace it with a genuine battery

299
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:20,640
on an old, crazy-ass old phone

300
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,930
that's barely in support anymore?

301
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,140
Think about it.

302
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:26,380
And this is the replacement adhesive.

303
00:11:26,383 --> 00:11:27,880
So what we have to do is,

304
00:11:27,883 --> 00:11:30,750
we gotta stick it back to where it was.

305
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,480
And then stick the battery on.

306
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,450
But before all that

307
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,040
we're not gonna stick it just yet.

308
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:36,110
We're gonna need to test it.

309
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:37,380
We're gonna test boot it and everything.

310
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:40,790
So, we'll probably have to attach all the display connectors.

311
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,950
So we can see if it goes on.

312
00:11:42,950 --> 00:12:00,580
(Sped up video)
(Connecting the battery for a test)

313
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,530
Let's try to boot it on and see if it works.

314
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,430
Voilà!

315
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:08,860
Battery health, no info.

316
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:10,930
Which I would expect, honestly.

317
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:13,330
Because Apple always have this

318
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,000
proprietary shit on them.

319
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,910
Where they have this thing right here.

320
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,430
Which is the BMS chip.

321
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:23,680
The battery management system chip.

322
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:28,230
Okay, now that we know the battery's working.

323
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:31,290
We can now go back to actually properly working on it.

324
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:47,460
(Sped up)
(This speed up was at 5000%, I'ma save you some hassle...)

325
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,250
Okay, secure.

326
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,130
Now, let's have...

327
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,180
Let's have a last moment.

328
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:59,010
Last confirmation moment.

329
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:01,010
No info, that's natural.

330
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:03,860
Because we're using a knockoff.

331
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,610
Right.

332
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:09,410
So, it is advised on the iFixIt guide.

333
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,510
That you should "charge it fully.

334
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:14,280
And then keep it charging for two more hours.

335
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:17,460
Then run it down till there's nothing left.

336
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:21,280
Then charge it fully to 100% uninterrupted."

337
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:26,580
Ooh, that would be days for me to work on this.
Ooh hoo hoo hoo.

338
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,310
I will work on that after the stream.

339
00:13:29,316 --> 00:13:32,310
Outside of the stream, I would immediately do that.

340
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:35,560
Because I do need to use this phone for a different project.

341
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:39,410
Which I will probably make a video out of.

342
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:42,760
So if you're wondering what I'm working on with this phone.

343
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:44,680
And what am I going to do with this phone.

344
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:46,930
You would know what I'm up to.

345
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:50,850
I highly appreciate you all for being here chilling with me

346
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,460
on this interesting journey

347
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:56,330
of, I don't know, weirdly enough,

348
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:00,010
two whole dang years of not doing anything tech.

349
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:05,110
This is the first ever tech-related stream I've ever done.

350
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:09,860
And I'm just more than happy that I finally got to do something tech

351
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:13,700
after marketing my channel as the Tech Wizardess for so long

352
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,810
and not doing anything tech.

353
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:19,360
Thank you all so so so so much for sticking around

354
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:20,850
and watching the hand-cam streams.

355
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,830
And, yeah.

356
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,330
I'll see you guys next week.

357
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,360
Have a good night, good day, whatever time it is.

358
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,860
See ya!

359
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,700
Yeet!

360
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:43,660
Special thanks to fellow Ko-fi supporters
for financially supporting me!

Thanks to Mint, Canadian and Jo!

361
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:53,750
Thank you for watching!
