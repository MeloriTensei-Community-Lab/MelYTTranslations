1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:02,890
So this video is gonna be a whole lot different

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:07,030
and I'm gonna start experimenting around with who I can be probably

3
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:09,160
quote-unquote "inspired by"

4
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:13,180
So in the past videos, you've been calling me DankPods from Temu

5
00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:15,760
and I kind of appreciate that as a joke, honestly

6
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,980
So how about have this video for a little change?

7
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:21,130
Hello everybody and welcome-

8
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:22,690
Oh fuck

9
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,250
That felt so unnatural

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,910
Kon-Melo and welcome back to another video

11
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:32,350
If you know who I'm referencing, please let me know in the comments

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,290
and today we're gonna have a very short and simple video

13
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,860
kind of showcasing what I have done to the phone

14
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:42,100
that I've mentioned in a past video.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,140
This is the Redmi Note 7 which is codenamed lavender

16
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:50,210
and a while ago I said that I'm not gonna be on crDroid for long

17
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,310
and not for long have I really done so.

18
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:57,140
So, I basically hop on to the said installer

19
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:58,430
surprising surprising

20
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,930
it does have an installer

21
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:03,730
and it simply just tells you to turn on developer options

22
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:07,680
and turn on USB debugging and make sure your bootloader is on

23
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:10,280
and plug in the device and away you go.

24
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:13,580
You're off to the races, which was shockingly simple

25
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,180
and insanely accessible.

26
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:18,980
At least, it's only accessible from the user-end.

27
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:22,980
However from the developer-end it comes in really tough

28
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:27,230
and the operating system we're gonna be talking about is

29
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:29,080
Ubuntu Touch

30
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,430
So what's so different about Ubuntu Touch?

31
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,750
So Ubuntu Touch is...

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,730
primarily just trying to be an alternative operating system.

33
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,430
You know how there's, on the PC

34
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:42,860
There is Windows and then there's Mac OS and then there's FreeBSD

35
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:45,200
and then there is Linux.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,760
With a whole lot of other distros using the Linux kernel.

37
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:51,860
Forgive the really husky voice that I currently have because

38
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:55,810
if you hadn't read my community post, I've gone sick in the past week.

39
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,180
So I'm still kind of trying to recover

40
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:01,830
and there's still remnants of phlegm inside my systems

41
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,630
that I'm still trying to get out.

42
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:06,450
But I can't wait to get this video out no matter what

43
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,810
So I don't really know much about Ubuntu Touch

44
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:12,440
And I have not really done too much research prior

45
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,410
because I don't really know where to start

46
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:19,500
So let's get straight on with my first impressions about this operating system.

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,330
It's...

48
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:24,880
overwhelmingly different in a way that it's yet so familiar yet.

49
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:29,730
So overwhelmingly different so like for the start you think

50
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,340
instinctively you would open the applications by clicking...

51
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:36,310
I don't know swiping up or something like that

52
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:41,360
whereas on Ubuntu, both the PC and the phone side,

53
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:46,750
you have something like GNOME where you have the application toggle

54
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,900
on the corner of the screen.

55
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,410
So like say the Ubuntu GNOME, you would have it on the top corner

56
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,960
or on the dock.

57
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,680
Whereas here it's right here in the bottom corner.

58
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:01,130
Sometimes it works, most of the time it does work.

59
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,050
But when I say sometimes it works, I mean like

60
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,060
when the touch kind of failed on me at times
(At the time of me trying out the OS for the first time,)

61
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:07,230
But most of the time it should work.
(which was long ago, it was on the Nexus 6P,)

62
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:11,460
So it opens up like a full application thingamajig
(where the touchscreen is broken AF.)

63
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:19,060
and on stock, surprising to me, that it has barcode reader by stock

64
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:22,080
So I don't know what you would use on a barcode reader

65
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:27,630
because the icon says QR code and the name says barcode.

66
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:29,210
It's a little bit confusing to me.

67
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:33,800
I have not done any tests because I don't have barcode to scan, unfortunately.

68
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,310
But I'm sure it'll be useful for some people

69
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:40,130
who are looking to use it on a QR code or something to connect to Wi-Fi

70
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,330
or something like that.

71
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,460
I'm not really too sure if this works on Ubuntu touch

72
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:46,080
So, please let me know in the comments below.

73
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,910
And then we finally also met with calculator, calendar,

74
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:54,210
camera, all the usual stuff and then this confuses me.

75
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:57,610
There is External Storage and then there's a File Manager.

76
00:03:57,616 --> 00:03:59,630
Why aren't they the same place?

77
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:01,160
Like on that one app.

78
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,330
Why is there a separate app called External Storage?

79
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,780
Now this is my very first time starting up this application.

80
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:09,630
So I don't really know what to expect out of it.

81
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,660
Well, that was taking quite long.
(After a whole minute...)

82
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:15,050
Well, disappointingly, I want to get out of here.

83
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,360
So how do we do that?

84
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:20,190
So there's two ways, so you don't really pull it up, unfortunately.

85
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,030
Because pulling up does nothing.

86
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:26,080
That's not what we do here in Ubuntu touch

87
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,850
Instead if you want to bring up the dock, you bring up from the left side.

88
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,080
So that's the dock.

89
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,980
However, if you want to bring up an app switcher,

90
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:38,160
which is what we usually use, you will bring it up from the right side.

91
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,310
So it brings up like a book like kind of pattern

92
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:45,010
and then to end the application you swipe it up and

93
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:46,260
you're back to the home screen.

94
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:47,660
So let's continue with that.

95
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:51,390
And then we got the gallery, media player, pretty classic stuff,

96
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,810
messaging

97
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:55,380
Then there's something called the Morph Browser.

98
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:59,100
I don't know why it did not come with Mozilla Firefox or something.

99
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,880
But I'm not too sure what the Morph Browser is because I haven't really touched it.

100
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:05,050
Then we got the music player, the notes,

101
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,710
and then there's something called the OpenStore.

102
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:10,960
Sounds a little different to me and I've never really heard of it.

103
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:13,030
But I have tried it for one application

104
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,980
and you'll see what I mean later.

105
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:17,910
And we got the phone, then we got the system settings,

106
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,310
terminal as per usual.

107
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:21,830
We got weather built-in and then

108
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,480
well, this is not really built-in

109
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:26,110
But I have installed YouTube through the OpenStore

110
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,130
We get into the OpenStore,

111
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,130
you just get into the OpenStore

112
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:32,660
and it kind of feels a little bit like the Canonical Store to some extent

113
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,830
but on mobile, so

114
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:39,000
There's a whole lot of open source application that you could kind of look for

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,160
and I'm sure a lot of people will find good use of it.

116
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,660
But to me it felt a little bit.

117
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,560
I don't know.

118
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:49,210
Maybe there's a little lot more open source usage.

119
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,310
Maybe it's just me.

120
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:53,830
I'm not really too sure but it does look like there's a whole lot of choice

121
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:58,080
I gotta be honest, but I haven't really see myself actually daily driving it

122
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,930
to the point that I have actually gotten used to it

123
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:01,680
So I don't really know much.

124
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:04,530
Oh my god, people still call it Google Mail

125
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,730
and then there's a whole lot of unofficial web app

126
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,810
that is to make up for the lack of applications that

127
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:14,130
that you can't really find on this platform primarily because

128
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:20,560
no one really sees this as a viable platform I guess, to make official programs of

129
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:24,310
So unfortunately, it's all heavily community open sourced

130
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:27,190
So you'll be mostly at the mercy of the community

131
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,750
to maintain the usability of the app

132
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,500
But sometimes it's good particularly on the Linux PC side

133
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,480
I actually found this to be not too big of an issue

134
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:40,710
But I'm not sure about how big of an issue would it be

135
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:44,160
for Ubuntu Touch primarily because of the far smaller community

136
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,510
and a far nicher community.

137
00:06:46,516 --> 00:06:49,350
I don't really see any Ubuntu users-

138
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,910
Sorry, Ubuntu Touch users even after the explosion of subscribers

139
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,680
and Discord users in my server.

140
00:06:56,683 --> 00:07:00,280
So I guess that's probably how niche it gets honestly,

141
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:02,580
but yeah, this is pretty much the OpenStore.

142
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:07,430
So let's say what if I want to get into something like say YouTube

143
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:10,560
and if we start off with just a YouTube web app

144
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:12,210
Oh, would you look at that?

145
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:15,940
So let's say I want to open up Michael MJD's videos

146
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:21,580
and considering the display is kind of capable of 1080p to some extent.

147
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:25,110
I wonder if this web app allows you to do so

148
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:27,080
Well, this is surprising.

149
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,830
You can go all the way up to 4K.

150
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,310
I assume it's probably because it's a web app

151
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:34,410
and it doesn't really know the real resolution

152
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,510
that the phone currently has, so...

153
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:41,000
It's just bringing you everything but will it actually go up there?

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,560
Michael: heck, even back then, it was probably a bit of a stretch.

155
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:46,190
Michael: As this is more of a small internet appliance

156
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,030
Michael: that could browse the web, check email, read ebooks,

157
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:51,130
Michael: and do a few other things too.

158
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:53,880
Michael: So, when I found this one for sale on e-
(Mel pauses)

159
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:54,560
You know,

160
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:56,810
it's surprisingly good, I guess.

161
00:07:56,816 --> 00:08:01,310
Albeit the web apps currently suffering with small things like

162
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:02,780
where's the title?

163
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:06,830
Maybe it's because the web app actually don't have a title up here

164
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,560
and then where's the like button?

165
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:11,180
Why can I only see the dislike button?

166
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:12,960
I think this is all pretty minor.

167
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:15,160
Can you drag it down to...

168
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,330
Oh yeah, you can do that.

169
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,850
Okay, that's cool

170
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:23,010
So it's almost insignificant, but it's still technically a web app to some extent

171
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:25,680
So you gotta have to navigate through the center console

172
00:08:25,683 --> 00:08:27,180
that takes you around like

173
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:30,690
different tabs that you're supposed to expect out of a YouTube app

174
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:35,530
except unfortunately, it's a web app because there's no official YouTube app here.

175
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:40,140
So these are some of the shortfalls of being an Ubuntu Touch users

176
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:41,360
as far as I can see

177
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:45,530
However, it doesn't really stop you from properly daily driving it

178
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:49,480
if you're not really a very niche users like say you got games on it

179
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,200
like HoYogames and stuff like that.

180
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,630
If you're just a completely normal user,

181
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:57,260
so if you see yourself using something like like a general apps like

182
00:08:57,266 --> 00:09:02,360
using it for office or some basic text messaging or some note-taking.

183
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:06,790
Then honestly, I don't really see how too big of a problem would it be

184
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,640
because I think it has reached a point where it's a bit functional

185
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,460
but not too functional to a point that is 100% reliable,

186
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:19,960
but it is still functional enough for it to be a working operating system

187
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,180
that you can actually use.

188
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:24,310
Now for people who are looking to tinker with this phone...

189
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:28,160
But before that, we're gonna quickly close off the applications here...

190
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,430
If you're looking to tinker with this phone,

191
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:33,910
fortunately, because it's Linux, because it's Ubuntu,

192
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:38,430
you can just feel free to open up the terminal and do your typical terminal things.

193
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:41,480
However, the default user always starts with "phablet"

194
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:44,580
and the device name is always "ubuntu-phablet"

195
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,700
and I mean you could do all the most basic things

196
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,250
like say for example updating your applications through apt

197
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,610
instead of using the OpenStore.

198
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:54,730
So like say

199
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:59,160
you can do "sudo apt update"

200
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:03,230
And then it's gonna ask for your password if you happen to have any password

201
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:04,890
which we'll get to that in a moment.

202
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,000
It's kind of a bit funny.

203
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,810
I gotta be honest

204
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:09,980
and then obviously you would have to go through repos and all that stuff,

205
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:14,780
typical of what apt does but on the phone, on ARM, in particular.

206
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:18,660
so you could pretty much do anything that you have already been doing here

207
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:22,880
except the major difference being is that you're facing with an architectural difference

208
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:26,890
which means the range of applications that you can install through apt

209
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:31,500
might be a bit limited and as not as far as I'm aware of

210
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,450
But when I was asking the question in my Discord server

211
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,060
about what should I do with Ubuntu Touch?

212
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:40,710
I've got requests of trying to run a Minecraft server on it.

213
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:44,660
But unfortunately, I could not find Java for Ubuntu touch.

214
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:48,110
There is not a repo that I'm aware of

215
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:52,210
that has Java or OpenJDK in some sort of way.

216
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:55,530
So I don't think it's possible at that moment

217
00:10:55,533 --> 00:11:00,260
because of the limitations of not being able to find a Java as a library

218
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:03,160
and trying to run Minecraft as client.

219
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:07,460
Unfortunately, too is a problem because apparently on some of the forums out there

220
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,290
that I've searched up on Google.

221
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:12,480
They say that there is missing OpenGL library.

222
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:17,480
So that too is not an option unfortunately, but if you have any ideas,

223
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:18,960
please let me know in the comments below

224
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:22,140
and maybe someone else could probably give it a try

225
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,680
But someone I did see there's one very oddly specific website

226
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:30,880
that actually manages to run a Minecraft server on Ubuntu Touch

227
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,430
Well, big props to you, I guess.

228
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:35,350
I don't know how the heck did you manage to bring Java over?

229
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,600
But great job, I guess kind of shows that it is very possible.

230
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,080
Whatever you could do on the desktop or as long as you know how to convert it to arm,

231
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,910
then it might be possible to bring it to Ubuntu Touch.

232
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,200
So yeah, there's that.

233
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,360
'Right. Let's get on to one of the thing that jumped out to me.

234
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:52,180
So when you locked up your device,

235
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:55,750
by the default settings, for probably some of the device,

236
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,160
or half the Android device, the "double touch to wake" is on by default

237
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,760
while the other half do not.

238
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:06,160
So like I'm sure the Pixels do not have it on.

239
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:11,040
Maybe I may be remembering it wrongly, but please correct me in the comments.

240
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:16,500
But specifically Samsung double tap to wake is, I think on.
(Correct me if I'm wrong.)

241
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,960
So instinctively, I did that and unfortunately, it doesn't wake up.

242
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:23,390
So I have to press the power button.

243
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,910
You'll be met with that which is kind of interesting

244
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,630
It's a bit, well, odd

245
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:34,110
I'm not really too sure what this signifies like this ring thingamajig.

246
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:36,530
But it kind of did confuse me a little bit.

247
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:40,180
So and then to unlock you can swipe either sides.

248
00:12:40,183 --> 00:12:43,730
So you can swipe to the left you swipe to the right any of the sides.

249
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:46,210
You can also bring up the dock if you feel like it,

250
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:48,880
which you can't really fully expand it, right?

251
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:51,730
Yeah, you have to unlock it before you can open it fully.

252
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:54,510
So it still takes you to home screen after that.

253
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:55,480
So...

254
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,860
right, so now getting into the screen lock part of things.

255
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:01,210
So to do that we go all the way down to system

256
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:05,010
and then we go security, privacy, locking and unlocking,

257
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:08,630
and then lock security and here you can use a passphrase.

258
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:12,480
You can use biometrics, you can use passcodes.

259
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:16,910
So what if I set a passcode like say one two, three four...

260
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,030
one two three four and set

261
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,510
and it'll ask you if you're doing a digits passcode

262
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:27,230
Would you like to have a keyboard prompt or would you like to have a circle pattern

263
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:31,500
which is a little different to me, I guess, from the sound of it.

264
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,890
So let's probably give it a try.

265
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,580
Oh, so you could add you can add some biometrics to it,

266
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,460
but I'm not gonna do that because I'm gloved.

267
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:43,530
So there's really no point doing that and let's have a look

268
00:13:45,816 --> 00:13:47,910
Oh okay,

269
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:53,530
that's interesting, one two three four...

270
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,730
It did jumped out to me earlier that it's that it says you can swipe to it

271
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,360
and you do that...

272
00:13:58,366 --> 00:13:59,510
(gasp)

273
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:00,580
What???

274
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,730
Okay, that is cool.

275
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:05,380
It's like you when when your finger enters the button it touches

276
00:14:05,383 --> 00:14:07,180
and then you leave it leaves.

277
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:07,810
That's kind of cool.

278
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:09,730
You can just swipe your way through it.

279
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:11,000
That's kind of awesome.

280
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,010
Well, the reason why I got impressed is because I was using the keyboard one

281
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:18,960
which was just a touch pad that is like a keyboard touch pad that you normally have

282
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:21,540
with a T9 dialing kind of thing.

283
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:26,100
So it was a bit unimpressive, but that meant for that particular style.

284
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,930
Right.

285
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,810
So there's one thing that was a bit funny with the terminal.

286
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:34,180
I just mentioned earlier and we're gonna get into that right now.

287
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,600
So on the start of the terminal, it would ask for your authentication

288
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,260
So instinctively you would type your password in

289
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:45,260
but it's using a full qwerty keyboard to do that

290
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:46,450
Hilarious, isn't it?

291
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,030
Okay

292
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:48,510
So now that we're in the terminal

293
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:52,330
like say, what if I want to do something like like "sudo apt" again.

294
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:57,680
So like say I press enter and then it says enter password for phablet.

295
00:14:57,683 --> 00:15:01,040
To some people you would think password and passcodes are different.

296
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:04,010
Unfortunately in this case, it's completely the same.

297
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:06,230
So you just type,

298
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:09,030
and you're through.

299
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,580
Which is kind of a bit funny to me at times

300
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,830
and rare times is a little bit funny.

301
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:18,750
Because like I thought if it had already asked you for your permissions

302
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,760
from the beginning when you open up the terminal app,

303
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:22,250
then why did it ask you again

304
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,700
when you when you execute a sudo command for the first time.

305
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,790
So I probably need some explanations to that.

306
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,630
So, please let me know in the comments below for that.

307
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:35,530
But yeah, however I don't really have plans of switching this phone

308
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:40,780
back to Android because there isn't really any ROMs out there that is kind of

309
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:44,850
maintained or functioned so I kind of want to stick around in Ubuntu Touch

310
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:50,760
and hopefully, with more comment suggestions, on what you want me to do with the phone

311
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:55,250
Then let me know and probably give me some exact instructions in the comments as well

312
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,000
so that I know what to do

313
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,010
Then maybe we'll test it out on another video.

314
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:02,560
But anyways with that said, thank you so much for watching

315
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:04,180
and be sure to subscribe.

316
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:08,780
Be sure to notification thingymajig like everything, if you like it.

317
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:10,180
You know what, you know what to do.

318
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:13,330
If you like gaming coming out of me, feel free to check out my live tab.

319
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,130
I'll be doing a lot of gameplay streams on the live tab

320
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:20,250
because I did realize that I could probably just have gaming on that side

321
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,810
and then a little bit of tech on this video side to keep my viewerbase balanced.

322
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:28,230
So yeah with that said, thank you so much for watching.

although I got really nervous.
