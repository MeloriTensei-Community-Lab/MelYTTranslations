Previously on Hololive Error

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,130
y'all doing fine?

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,840
Well, I'm not sure about myself though.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,410
Here goes nothing.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:12,730
Begin.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:15,900
Uh…

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,650
WHA-

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:21,500
YEET!

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,080
UWARGH!

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,300
What…

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,230
really happened?

12
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,610
Wait, I see a leg.

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,760
Something's not right.

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:40,910
Wha-

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:41,560
Huh?

16
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,410
Nani [What]?

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,430
What's going on?

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,550
UWARGH!!!

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,130
Who are you?

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:01,690
WHA-

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:07,680
Eh?

22
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,630
Wait, there's multiple endings to this game?

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:13,660
Right.

24
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,510
Let's try to get the second ending.

25
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:26,960
Morning.

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,780
There's a note here.

27
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,760
Okay.

28
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,660
Relax.

29
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,610
Relax, Mel.

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,340
You've seen us before.

31
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,410
Hello.

32
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,560
What if we ignore her and we walk forward?

33
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,110
What would she do if we just kept walking forward?

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,750
UGH-

35
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,440
She's still there.

36
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:01,730
Wait.

37
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,480
We can ignore her for now.

38
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,310
See if that changes anything.

39
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,660
B-d-b-d-b-d-b-d-

40
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,400
Shut up.

41
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,050
Alright.

42
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,050
F-

43
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,530
Fuck me, that still gets me.

44
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,780
What the hell.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,690
Oh.

46
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,180
Here we go.

47
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,690
It's about god-fucking-damn time.

48
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,360
Okay.

49
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,940
Fweeeh.

50
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,510
Still gets me.

51
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,310
So, previously,

52
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,010
we went forward and the whole thing went dark.

53
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,030
What if we take a different route?

54
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,560
I- I know I haven't walked here

55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,050
in the- in the-

56
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,160
in my first run.

57
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,690
So this is my fir- my- my first run here, then.

58
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,090
It's a note.

59
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,230
Note from a certain-

60
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,930
She's here.

61
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,310
"You don't need to suffer like this anymore.

62
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,510
It wasn't your fault.

63
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,680
I'm gonna make sure nothing like that ever happens in this town again.

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,900
Which is why..."

65
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay, so we got a brand new note.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,831
We got a brand new note.

67
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:02,210
That- we have not had that note, okay?

68
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,930
We have not had that note.

69
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,810
Wha-

70
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,760
The lights just went on.

71
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,660
Hello?

72
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,860
What happened here?

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,410
Oh no, it's that- it's that thing again.

74
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,060
It's the landslide again.

75
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,480
Lights went up, and I heard steps.

76
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,980
Who the fuck are you?!

77
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,360
I see tables.

78
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,560
Art room?

79
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,230
Okay, we have not been here before.

80
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,410
On the first run, we have not been here before.

81
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,380
Nothing in the canvas.

82
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,030
Right.

83
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,060
Wha-

84
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,730
Who's that?

85
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,030
Wait, who-

86
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,650
"My head hurts.

87
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,110
What's happening to me?

88
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,610
I paint, and I paint, but everything comes out looking wrong.

89
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,210
Is this truly the best I can do?"

90
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,340
[To chat] Hello, Xoly.

91
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,810
Oh, it's gone dark.

92
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,260
Here we are, in the shrine.

93
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,060
Nope,

94
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,840
we haven't gotten anything different.

95
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,168
I just went to grab some candy so I can chew on to it.

96
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:25,010
But hilariously-

97
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,360
Hilariously, there's one candy that just stood out to me,

98
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,130
and I just had to try it, even though it tastes horrible right now.

99
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:41,330
So this candy that I found is a double corn candy.

100
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,280
You heard me, it's literally corn.

101
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,660
Like, what the heck?

102
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,080
Why do people make candy out of corn?

103
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,300
It tastes so weird.

104
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, who was that?

105
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,280
It's the dude A, right?

106
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,280
Alright, let's keep walking.

107
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,860
Let's keep walking quickly.

108
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,830
Typical Southeast Asian behavior.

109
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,840
Uh, let's- let's- uh, let's-

110
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,580
Why- why did I forget about that part?

111
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,210
I got scared about that on the first run.

112
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,050
That happened to me again.

113
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,610
Alright, let's look around.

114
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,460
Let's check- check if there's anything.

115
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,650
An unopened milk carton.

116
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,110
Hololive chocolate?

117
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,580
Chocolate?

118
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,110
Did you say chocolate?

119
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,250
Chocolate?

120
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,560
Chocolate?!

121
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,380
Chocolate?!

122
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,330
Okay.

123
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,780
And there's a note.

124
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,150
"You can't go that way you can't go that way you can't go that way you can't go that way.

125
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,410
Who's this 'Yuka' person

126
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,960
Who's this 'Yuka' person?"

127
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,940
Oh!

128
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,180
Okay…

129
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,030
Here she is.

130
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,160
There's a note right where she's sitting.

131
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,910
Oh no!

132
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,680
We were supposed to grab it!

133
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,310
Okay, let's try going through it as fast as we can.

134
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,660
So, we have very, very little time window to grab the note.

135
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,610
Two…

136
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,081
Three…

137
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:20,230
And…

138
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,460
Four.

139
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,310
Walk up.

140
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,030
Oh, there it is!

141
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,190
We got the note, we got the note!

142
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,100
"If you want to change something, you need to take action.

143
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,634
I know that, but I didn't used to think that way."

144
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:40,510
Okay, we got it, we got it!

145
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,930
Okay, nobody is in the room.

146
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,560
Oh, there's a chair.

147
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,760
There's an extra chair.

148
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,630
Wha-

149
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,680
What is she doing here?

150
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,550
She disappeared.

151
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,060
Why was she here?

152
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,365
Why?

153
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,940
What is she doing here?

154
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,510
There is a door banging.

155
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,050
Wha-

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,543
Okay, it's different now.

157
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:03,060
Our first ending used to have a cutscene.

158
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
I think there's more to this now.

159
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,310
Chapter 8.

160
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,710
So, we're on a-

161
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,350
Oh, fuck me, the landslide is happening again.

162
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,630
What is it this time?

163
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,830
Oh, no.

164
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:35,380
So, this is everything together in one place.

165
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,280
Oh, no.

166
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,010
Wait, can we go through when the door-

167
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,300
No, we cannot.

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,260
What's going on?

169
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,481
Hey, yo.

170
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,140
Uh…

171
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,260
This is a whole lot different than the first run.

172
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,130
I-

173
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,250
And there's a note here.

174
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,703
WARGH!!!

175
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:15,280
Jesus Christus.

176
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,060
Okay, so we got a note.

177
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,210
"Record of Grandfather's investigation. "Cause of the Supernatural Phenomena"

178
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,510
I haven't been feeling well since I started investigating the woods.

179
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,500
For days on end, I've been wracked by constant headaches.

180
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,280
I can't think of any other explanation than those woods.

181
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,180
Are the spirits of the people buried there taking vengeance on the living?

182
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,160
Come to think of it, there's an old shrine in Aogami.

183
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,210
Maybe I'll find some clues there.

184
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,880
It's worth looking into."

185
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,610
It's getting more and more chaotic now.

186
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,940
Oh, no.

187
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,860
Huh?

188
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,250
What are you doing here?

189
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,210
Woah.

190
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,910
This is way different than I thought.

191
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,390
This second ending has more stuff going on.

192
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,010
Okay, this is-

193
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,440
I thought I could brave up because I already know what-

194
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,610
how the game is going to go, but-

195
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,260
Turns out there's more stuff packed into it than I thought.

196
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,780
It's that dog girl.

197
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,910
Okay.

198
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,210
And the door is open.

199
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,660
Any notes?

200
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,630
Has she left any notes?

201
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,430
No?

202
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,530
Multiple knockings?

203
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,980
And hands?

204
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,210
Nani (What)?

205
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,410
What?

206
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,580
What's going on?

207
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,390
Yuka.

208
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,960
Okay.

209
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,250
It has been played out to us again.

210
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,980
That piece of history.

211
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,500
Okay, train stops.

212
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,580
Okay.

213
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,030
What are we expecting?

214
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,310
Who are you?

215
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,560
What are you doing?

216
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,190
What's going on?

217
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,380
We're back in school again.

218
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,110
Aogami High in present time.

219
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,380
I shouldn't be in this-

220
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,010
In this time?

221
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,550
In this time frame?

222
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,900
What do you mean?

223
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,440
This is the present time.

224
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,750
Nande [Why]?

225
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,560
Why?

226
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,860
Why are you here for?

227
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,572
Why are you after me for?

228
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:18,939
What is going on?

229
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:20,880
A note.

230
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,330
Rubbled school.

231
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,680
"I feel like my head's going to burst.

232
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,350
Is that the shrine?

233
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,480
Is that over the-

234
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,330
must be.

235
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:32,610
I see.

236
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,680
It all makes sense now.

237
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,647
It's the

238
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:39,860
Aono...mi...

239
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,830
So this is...

240
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,710
fate that...

241
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,550
who arrive...

242
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,730
the truth.

243
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,260
I must conti...

244
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,190
Whoa!

245
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,937
Must go through- Oh no.

246
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:20,280
He went through.

247
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,280
You don't say.

248
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,610
I- I think I know what's up with this-

249
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,010
With that dude now.

250
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,600
Why?

251
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,430
Why are you stopping us?

252
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,830
What is it that you're hiding?

253
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,680
Tell me!

254
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,480
Is this all

255
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,330
just a dream?

256
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,100
Who is it?

257
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,280
She's here!

258
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,410
Okay!

259
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,680
Fuck me that-

260
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,180
Ending 2?

261
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,710
I still don't understand.

262
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,580
Why?

263
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,230
So there's something different going on

264
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,940
in chapter- chapter 5.

265
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,080
That's probably-

266
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,680
That's probably ending number 3.

267
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,190
We're missing a note.

268
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,510
Two notes.

269
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,830
I- I think we might be able to find these

270
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,630
on- on- on- on the third ending.

271
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,130
Oh it is!

272
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,430
Look at that!

273
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,750
Chapter 8 is a- is a longer one.

274
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,810
Like, okay.

275
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,880
I see.

276
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,960
Right.

277
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,110
Interesting.

278
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,390
There's still something that gets me curious.

279
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,210
Like, who- who was the-

280
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,210
who's the one that's cursifying Aogami?

281
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,180
Like, who's the culprit behind it?

282
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,580
Why did they do this?

283
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,130
What is the- what is the grand motive?

284
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,710
This still left me very very curious.

285
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,480
Extremely curious.

286
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,230
I'm gonna relax, clear my head,

287
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,280
and um, thank you guys-

288
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,530
thank you all for watching.

289
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,030
This is the first time I've actually

290
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,647
gone really far with planning out a stream.

291
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:45,280
The funniest part about planning out a stream though,

292
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,130
is that it took me-

293
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,460
I mean I- I- I only started doing all the planning

294
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,880
literally yesterday.

295
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,000
I've done everything starting yesterday, so this is like- this is like

296
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,100
some sort of like a ch- a self-challenge of how to set up

297
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,230
a fully elaborate stream in all- all in- in a matter of 24 hours.

298
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,380
Isn't it nuts that content creators these days can now set up-

299
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,060
set up crazy elaborate things in a short period of time?

300
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,640
Well I'm- I'm surprised too because of how- how much- how much I'm able to do

301
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,350
even- even with my rusty skills.

302
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,360
So...

303
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,610
But- but yeah.

304
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,780
Man I'm talking too much.

305
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,600
I- I'll talk more about it on- on the next stream.

306
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
But yeah.

307
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,760
Thank you all so much for watching.

308
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,930
And as always,

309
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,390
take care.

310
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,680
Have a good night!

311
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:59,500
