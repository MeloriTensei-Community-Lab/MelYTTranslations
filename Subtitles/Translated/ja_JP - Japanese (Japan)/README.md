# Japanese Translations
### Translation Guidelines (specifically for Japanese)
Translation to Kon-Melo can be of either half Hira-Kata (こんメロ) or full Katakana (コンメロ) but it'd be preferable to be Hira-Kata for style. Full Hiragana might look a little weird.

My friend, KZF1,'s name will be localized as Chikin (チキン), as Chicken is what he informally goes by for others convenience.
