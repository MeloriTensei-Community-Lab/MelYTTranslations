## Translation Guidelines (specifically for Japanese)
> Guidelines are placed to ensure the quality control 
> of subtitles are up to par for each translator.
> However, not every language has the same guidelines
> for the rules of translations.
> Thus, the guidelines here mainly focus on
> translation mentality rather than format.

#### Consistent tones and formalities
```
At times, I might get informal as heck. Try to match the tones you've
heard from medias like TV shows, movies or even VTuber conversations.
```

#### Melori's greeting localization
```
It can be in both Hybrid
✅ こんメロ
or Full Katakana
✅ コンメロ
(Preferably Hybrid) 

But not full Hiragana because it looks weird.
❌ こんめろ
```
   
#### Friends' name localization
```
KZF1/Chicken = `チキン` (Chikin)

SqueakyChair = `キイ椅子` (Ki-i-ko)
(yes, I know 椅子 translates to isu, 
but if you got any better sounding ideas,
drop me a discussion ticket)

Aerostatik/Aero = Nothing at the moment, up to debate
```
