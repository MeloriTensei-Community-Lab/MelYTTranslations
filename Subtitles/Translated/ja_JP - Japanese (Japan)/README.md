# Japanese Translations

## Translation Guidelines (specifically for Japanese)

#### Consistent tones and formalities
```
At times, I might get informal as heck. Try to match the tones you've heard from medias
like TV shows, movies or even VTuber conversations.
```

#### Melori's greeting localization

    It can be in both Hybrid (こんメロ) or Full Katakana (コンメロ). (Preferably Hybrid)
    But not full Hiragana because it looks weird.
   
#### Friends' name localization

    KZF1/Chicken = チキン (Chikin)
    SqueakyChair = キイ椅子 (Ki-i-ko) (yes, I know 椅子 translates to isu, but if you got any better sounding ideas, drop me a discussion ticket)
    Aerostatik/Aero = Nothing at the moment, up to debate
