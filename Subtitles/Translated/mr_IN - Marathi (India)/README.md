## Translation Guidelines (specifically for Marathi)
> Guidelines are placed to ensure the quality control 
> of subtitles are up to par for each translator.
> However, not every language has the same guidelines
> for the rules of translations.
> Thus, the guidelines here mainly focus on
> translation mentality rather than format.

#### Consistent tones and formalities
```
At times, I might get informal as heck. Try to match the tones you've
heard from medias like TV shows, movies or even VTuber conversations.
```

#### More rules unavailable
```
This language only existed because of a single random contribution.
So there wasn't any clear ruleset from that contributor yet.
