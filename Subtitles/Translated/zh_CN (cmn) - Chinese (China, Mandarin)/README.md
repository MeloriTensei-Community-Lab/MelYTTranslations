## Translation Guidelines (specifically for Mandarin Chinese)
> Guidelines are placed to ensure the quality control 
> of subtitles are up to par for each translator.
> However, not every language has the same guidelines
> for the rules of translations.
> Thus, the guidelines here mainly focus on
> translation mentality rather than format.

#### Consistent tones and formalities
```
At times, I might get informal as heck. Try to match the tones you've
heard from medias like TV shows, movies or even VTuber conversations.
```

#### Melori's name localization
```
The official localization of Melori is 甘乐 (GanYue).

As for her title of being a Tech Wizardess, there isn't a final decision yet. Feel free to discuss about it in the Discussions ticket.
```
   
#### Friends' name localization
```
There are currently no final localization for all my friends' names it'll be up to debate for 
```
