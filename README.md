# MeloriTensei's video subtitles
#### Translations repo for MeloriTensei's YouTube Channel
Welcome to the GitHub repo where Mel hosts her subtitles in hopes to further ease the process of getting volunteer subtitlers to subtitle her videos. At this moment, it serves as a repo for translations as the base English subtitles are still made in house by Mel.

## Languages covering
Base Language: English - United States (`en_US`)

# Guide to contributing
Step 1: Grab your favorite subtitling suite ([Subtitle Edit](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit) and [Aegisub](https://aegisub.org/) are good options if you're someone just starting out but anything works!).

Step 2: Subtitle and translate any video(s) that you would like and export it (or them) as one of the accepted filetypes by YouTube, as listed in the link attached to the `Contributors Guidelines` section.

Step 3: Fork this repo.

Step 4: Create a folder for your language in the `Subtitles` folder following this template: ISO3166-1_Code - [Translation] LanguageName (Country). Real world example: ro_RO - [Translation] Romanian (Romania).

Step 5: Add your translations to said folder. Although optional, it would be ideal to include a link to the translated video in the commit description. Tracking what has already been translated is easier this way and will make it clear to future contributors that those subtitles don't need to be done again.

Step 6: Create a pull request on the main repo, adding a short description to the content that you wish to be attached to the main repo.

Step 7: Wait for it to be approved.

Step 8: PROFIT!!!

# Contributors Guidelines
This section serves the purpose to keep the subtitles quality to a certain standard.

Accepted formats: all that YT supports (Refer to YouTube Help [here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698 "here").)

------------


#### Rule 1: Neatly space sentences within the two line limit of YouTube's subtitle system
The usual format goes as follows:
> First line: subtitle
>
> Second line: (On screen text)

It's best to space the context of the sentence accordingly to a new line/next track if it helps the sentence. This allows the views to see each line of text for nearly equal amount of time and have contexts in one line should viewers look away for a split second. There are not exact character limits due to the way subs are rendered on the YouTube Player ([Reference: Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/3peq4x/maximum_character_length_for_subtitles/ "Referrence: Reddit")).

**Note: The "next line" here refers to the next track/clip in timeline.**
##### **✅Correct✅**
>So one of the fatal problems it has right now
>
>is battery related issues.

##### **❌Incorrect❌**
>So one of the fatal problems it has right now is battery
>
>related issues.

------------

#### Rule 2: Only push when you're fully done with each video. Because I would only just do some minor checks and upload the file straight to YT.

------------

#### Rule 3: While AI assisted translations are not forbidden, submissions which ONLY use AI will be rejected. This will help keep the translations coherent and in a quality manner.
------------

#### Rule 4: Be respectful of other contributors. It is encouraged for translators and subtitlers of the same language to come together and solve conflicts relating to the project(s) if they arise. Disagree with something? Point out the flaw(s) in a comment on the pull request or Issues ticket!

------------

#### Rule 5: Be coherent. When translating, translate the entire sentence and make sure that the final product interconnects for the best reading experience.

------------

#### Rule 5: Sound effects are occasionally missed out in some videos, just translate accordingly whether there are SFX or not.

------------

#### Rule 6: No shameless promoting in the subtitles file, your name will be credited accordingly in the subtitle name itself.
